# Simple RAG Chatbot

A simple chatbot that can answer questions about a specific paragraph using RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation).

## How it works:
1. Takes a paragraph of text
2. Breaks it into sentences
3. When you ask a question, it finds the most relevant sentences
4. Uses OpenAI's GPT to generate an answer based on those sentences

## To use:
1. Get an OpenAI API key from https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
2. Enter your API key in the sidebar
3. Ask questions about the paragraph!

## To customize:
- Replace the `YOUR_PARAGRAPH` variable in `app.py` with your own text
- The chatbot will then answer questions about your paragraph instead

## Features:
- Chat interface
- Shows which sentences were used to answer your question
- Works with any paragraph you provide
- No local installation needed!
