Esperanza conducts pre-employment background checks on all applicants who accept an offer of employment. All offers of employment or volunteering at Esperanza are contingent upon clear results of a thorough background check. Background checks will be conducted for or requested of individuals in the following circumstances:  Job candidates to whom offers of employment have been made  Employees who are being promoted into new positions, as deemed necessary by the individual requirements of the position  Current employees whose current criminal background checks have aged will be checked every three years. Employees will be notified by HR of their expiring clearances and given instructions and a deadline for completing them.  Child abuse and Criminal: Mental Health professionals, Clinicians, nurses, social workers, medical assistants, dietitians, and any other employee whose job involves regular and repeated contact with children.  Criminal only: All other employees  For job applicants, background checks will not be requested or conducted during the employment application process, but only after a conditional offer of employment has been made in compliance with Pennsylvania law.

Pre-employment background checks will include:  Pennsylvania (PA) Criminal Background clearance  Child Abuse History check (when applicable to the position): PA Child Abuse clearance, and FBI Fingerprint-based clearance  Social Security Verification: validates the applicant's Social Security number, date of birth and former addresses.  Personal and Professional References: calls will be placed to individuals listed as references by the applicant.  Medicare/Medicaid Exclusion Checks: Checks for Medicare/Medicaid fraud history. 

An HR representative will contact employees regarding the renewal of aged clearances. Background check information will be kept on file by HR for at least five years. Final candidates for employment and volunteers will complete the background check authorization form and return it to Human Resources (HR). Human Resources will order the background checks upon receipt of the signed release form, and either internal HR staff or an employment screening service will conduct the checks. A designated HR representative will review all results.

If there are no negative results, the applicant or volunteer will continue with the onboarding process. In instances where negative or incomplete information is obtained, the hiring manager and the Director of Human Resources will conduct an assessment to determine the potential risks and liabilities related to the job's requirements and make a recommendation to the CEO regarding hiring or not hiring the individual. If a decision is made by the CEO to not hire or promote a candidate based on the result of the background check, the decision should be documented in writing and signed by the CEO. HR will follow all applicable laws regarding notifying the candidate of the rejection. If information obtained in a background check leads Esperanza to deny employment, a copy of the report will be provided to the applicant, and the applicant will have the opportunity to dispute the report’s accuracy. All background checks are conducted in conformity with the Federal Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Americans with Disabilities Act, and state and federal privacy and anti-discrimination laws. Reports are kept confidential and are only viewed by individuals involved in the hiring process. Licensed employees or contractors will be subject to other background checks as required by law and/or government contract recommendations. Sources for these reviews may include, but not limited to, System for Award Management (SAM), Office of Inspector General List of Excluded Individuals/Entities, National Practitioner Data Bank, and Pennsylvania Medicheck.

Esperanza has developed employment classifications for employees to understand their employment status. These classifications are as follows: 1. Full-time employees are those whose regularly scheduled work week consists of 32 or more hours. Employees who work 32 hours a week or more are eligible to participate in all employee benefits described more fully in this Handbook and/or the Human Resources Policy and Procedure Manual. 2. Part-time employees are those whose regularly scheduled work week consists of fewer than 32 hours per week. Part-time permanent employees are eligible to participate in employee health benefits if they are scheduled to work 24 hours a week or more. Employees scheduled to work less than 24 hours per week do not qualify to participate in group health, dental, life, and long-term disability insurance. However, all part-time employees can participate in the Esperanza Health Center 401(k) plan and, in certain cases more fully described in the Esperanza Health Center 401(k) Summary Plan Description, are eligible to receive Esperanza matching or discretionary contributions. Part-time employees that work extra hours across departments on an occasional, voluntary basis will only receive benefits entitled to them as per their hired position.

3. Per-diem employees are those employees who work less than 24 hours a week or are employed to fill in for other special needs. Such employees are not eligible to participate in employee benefits. 4. Temporary employees are employees hired to work for less than 12 months, either full or part- time. Part-time temporary employees are not eligible to participate in employee benefits. Temporary employees who work more than 30 hours per week are eligible for health insurance after 90 days (about 3 months) if upon hire, the position is designated to be 30 or more hours per week. If the number of hours per week is not known, the temporary employee will be considered a variable hour employee and subject to the rules of that employment classification. Temporary employees are entitled to sick leave according to Philadelphia law and proportionate to the hours they are scheduled to work. Sick paid time off is accrued from the date of hire to a maximum of seven days per year. 5. Probationary employees are those who have not yet completed 90 days (about 3 months) of employment with Esperanza. They accrue any vacation time, personal holiday, and sick time benefits for which they are eligible during this time but may not use these benefits until after the satisfactory completion of their probationary period. Probationary employees may be paid at a lower rate during their training period. 6. Conditional employees are those placed on conditional status as a disciplinary measure as discussed in Policy 9.2, Progressive Discipline. 7. Variable hour employees are those who, upon their start date, it cannot be determined that the employee is expected to work on average at least 8. 30 hours per week. A look- back measure of 6 months (following the 1000-hour rule) will be used to assess whether the variable hour employee will receive health insurance benefits. 

In addition, all positions are classified as exempt or non-exempt status based upon the Federal and state wage and hour laws: 1. Non-exempt hourly employees are those in support staff positions as defined by the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA). These employees are paid hourly and entitled to overtime pay at time and a half, if asked to work over 40 hours in the work week by Esperanza. All overtime must be approved by the employee’s supervisor prior to working. Non-exempt employees receive a one-hour lunch break; 30 minutes are unpaid and the remaining 30 minutes are designated as two 15- minute breaks. 2. Non-exempt salaried employees are those in administrative and managerial positions as defined by the FLSA. These employees are paid a salary and entitled to overtime pay at time and a half, if requested to work over 40 hours in the work week by Esperanza. Non- exempt salaried employees receive a half-hour lunch break, which is unpaid. 3. Exempt employees are those in executive, administrative, professional, and other positions as defined by the FLSA. These employees are paid a salary and are exempt from overtime. Exempt employees receive a half-hour lunch break, which is unpaid.

Esperanza will use volunteers sometimes to fulfill the health center's needs and provide educational and training opportunities to students, interns, and residents. This policy outlines the documentation and orientation requirements for volunteer positions and student rotations before starting service.  All volunteers must complete the Esperanza Health Center Volunteer or Student Rotation Application; complete an orientation of Esperanza policies; and complete and sign a HIPAA Confidentiality statement. Depending upon the service provided, volunteers may be requested to provide a copy of their Pennsylvania Criminal Background clearance.  Clinical volunteers for patient care and support positions (including students and residents) must provide:  Copies of valid, current licenses, certifications (if applicable) and CPR certificate  Evidence of OSHA training (or complete Esperanza’s OSHA training and post-test)  Evidence of current immunizations (HepB and TB)  Evidence of current liability insurance All documentation should be provided before the start of the assignment. For all volunteers and students covered by this policy, a file must be kept by the manager or supervisor and the application should be kept on file with the Human Resources Manager’s records in the Human Resources department. Volunteers, interns, and student residents may be issued an Esperanza identification (ID) card. When an ID card is required, students and/or volunteers must report to Human Resources to obtain the ID card and for the completion of onboarding.

If a former Esperanza employee returns to Esperanza after a break in service, his or her new start date will be the date of rehire. Rehired employees are probationary employees for the first 90 days of their employment, but are not eligible to use their accrued vacation, personal day, or sick paid time off until the probationary period is completed. Returning employees may or may not be rehired for the same position or same pay.

Esperanza will provide assistance to new employees in their transition into their new position at Esperanza. The Human Resources Department conducts new Employee Orientation and Onboarding. During onboarding, the employee must provide proof of identification for employment verification and complete all administrative paperwork including the following: job description review, facility tour, W-4 Employment Withholding Form, I-9 Employment Verification, and the Authorization for Direct Deposit form. OSHA Training is completed during the first 10 days of employment. Employees must complete the OSHA post-test to ensure there is a proper understanding of EHC safety policies and procedures. Orientation will normally be conducted within the employee’s first month of employment. Esperanza orientation includes an overview of Esperanza’s personnel policies and procedures, HIPAA training, information technology and electronic medical records training, health benefits orientation, and 401(k) plan orientation. Additional training and orientation will be conducted by the employee’s department for job specific training. Certain positions require participation in continuing education and training programs when such instruction is considered necessary for satisfactory job performance, licensure, or credentials. Time spent in orientation and onboarding is considered working hours and employees will be compensated for that time. Employees are encouraged to discuss questions about orientation and onboarding with their supervisor at any time. 

Esperanza expects employees to wear an Esperanza identification (ID) card to promote safety and uniformity. The identification card should be visible so all can view and allow staff to be identified as an Esperanza employee. Obstructions of your ID card should be avoided. An ID card will be issued on the first day of employment during the Human Resources Orientation. Employees are expected to wear their Esperanza ID card at all times when working. The ID card should be free from distracting stickers, pens, or anything that would conflict with the image of Esperanza’s mission. Failure to adhere to this can lead to disciplinary action. Replacement of lost identification cards will cost the employee $5.00. The ID card is the property of Esperanza and must be collected by the manager or Human Resources Director during the exit interview or when an employee is terminated. All ID cards will be returned to the Human Resources Department after termination of employment.

Esperanza typically adheres to a 40-hour work week for employees. This policy outlines the hours of operation during which the health center provides services and the regular work schedule for non- exempt and exempt employees. Esperanza’s clinical hours are Monday through Saturday. A work week begins Sunday at 12:00 a.m. and ends Saturday at 11:59 p.m. Some weekend and evening hours may be required from all employees. Hourly employees cannot begin work or perform any work related duties prior to the beginning of the normal work day (8:30 a.m. to 5:00 p.m.), unless specific authorization from the supervisor is given. Similarly, hourly employees cannot continue work beyond the end of their normal day without specific authorization from their supervisor. Exempt employees are hired to complete specific job duties and tasks that are associated with a job position without regard to specific hours. Exempt employees are expected to work the hours necessary to complete their work without the expectation of additional compensation. All employees must understand that, because of unusually heavy patient volume, special projects or emergencies, extra work time may occasionally be required. In these instances, which may occur with or without advance notice, staff members will be expected to fulfill their responsibilities as necessary to ensure good patient care. 
Esperanza desires to foster a work environment of excellence in which timeliness and consistent attendance is the professional expectation of all employees. Esperanza encourages all employees to have habits of good attendance and punctuality. Employees are expected to report to and be prepared to work by 8:30 a.m. and attend devotions, prayer groups, or other scheduled meetings between 8:30 and 9:00 a.m. unless previous authorization is given from the employee’s supervisor. Employees are not allowed to eat breakfast on work time unless approval from a supervisor is granted. Unauthorized absence(s) or tardiness will not be tolerated and may result in disciplinary action or dismissal. 

Procedure – Unscheduled Absence: At times, circumstances beyond an employee’s control may result in an unexpected absence from work for either all or part of a day. In these cases, the procedure outlined in this paragraph should be followed and supporting documentation may be requested by the employee’s supervisor or the Human Resources Director. To maintain a work environment of excellence, employees are expected to clearly and proactively communicate with their supervisor if they will be absent. If an employee is unable to report for work on a given day, he or she is required to call and speak personally with his or her supervisor no later than one hour before the scheduled starting time, unless alternative arrangements have been arranged with the employee’s supervisor. When speaking with their supervisor, employees should describe the reason for the absence. Because of the need to plan for covering open positions, messages via the supervisor’s voice mail or other third parties are not acceptable. Text communication for call-outs is allowed as determined by each department manager. Communication should occur as soon as possible but no later than 7:30 a.m. so that alternate staffing arrangements can be made. Text, as well as oral communication, should 1) be two-way; 2) close the loop about duties during the day that need to be completed in the employee’s absence; 3) be prompt; and 4) be oral, if needed, to close the loop. The employee should keep his/her phone on and be accessible to talk with the supervisor if needed. 

If employees are unable to reach their supervisor, they should contact and communicate with the next person who is designated by the supervisor. Failure to communicate directly to someone may result in a disciplinary action. If after several attempts, the employee is not able to communicate directly to a manager, he or she may leave a voicemail for the supervisor, but must follow up with a phone call at the beginning of the business day to personally inform his or her manager of the absence.

Unpaid time off is approved only under extraordinary circumstances (see 6.2 Personal and Medical Leave) and with available coverage for clinic functions. Requests for unpaid time off will be reviewed by the employee’s supervisor and the Human Resources Director for possible approval only after all accrued sick, vacation, personal, or other paid time off has been expended. Supporting documentation may be requested by the employee’s supervisor or the Human Resources Director Employees who are absent from work for three consecutive days without notice or communication with their supervisor or human resources will be considered as having quit voluntarily.

Disciplinary action will be taken in the event that an employee has four unscheduled absences, within a 60-day time period, unless prior approval for reporting late to work for activities such as attending doctor’s appointments, court hearings, school meetings, or other personal requests was given by the department supervisor 24 hours in advance. The progressive disciplinary actions for more than four unscheduled absences in a 60-day time period will include the following: 1. First verbal warning. 2. Second verbal warning. 3. Written warning. 4. First loss of vacation time accrued within the current pay period. 5. Second loss of vacation time accrued within the current pay period. 6. Review by CEO, Human Resources Director, and immediate supervisor, with employees placed in a 60-day conditional period. As stated in Section 9.2 Progressive Discipline, during the conditional period, the employee will receive full salary and benefits. If the problem is not corrected during the conditional period, employment may be terminated. If, after a successful conditional period the problem reoccurs, the employee may be terminated. 7. Temporary suspension. As stated in Section 9.2 Progressive Discipline, an employee may be temporarily suspended or permanently dismissed for the following reasons, including but not limited to, poor job performance or failure to comply with the policies and procedures of Esperanza. This is a time without pay and all accrual of benefit time will also be suspended. 8. Decision by CEO, Human Resources Director, and immediate supervisor whether to continue to employ or dismiss the employee. As stated in Section 9.2 Progressive Discipline, an employee may be dismissed at any time, including just cause as discussed in Rules of Conduct. Dismissal will be effective immediately. 

Depending on the severity of the infraction, Esperanza maintains the right to skip any of these steps and move directly to dismissal.

If employees are not able to arrive on time for work, they are required to call and speak personally with their supervisor to explain that they will be late, the reason for the tardiness, and their expected time of arrival. The employee may also text the supervisor, if this has been approved by the department manager. This call or text should be made as soon as employees know they will be late, unless alternative arrangements have been worked out with their supervisor. Messages via the supervisor’s voice mail or other third parties are not acceptable. If employees are unable to reach their supervisor, they should contact and speak with the next person who is designated by the supervisor. Failure to speak directly to someone may result in a disciplinary action. If after several attempts, the employee is not able to speak directly to a manager, he or she may leave a voicemail for the supervisor, but must follow up with a phone call to personally inform his or her manager of the tardiness

Disciplinary action will be taken in the event that an employee has four tardy incidents (more than one minute late) within a 60-day time period, unless prior approval for reporting late to work for activities such as attending doctor’s appointments, court hearings, school meetings, or other personal requests was given by the department supervisor 24 hours in advance. The progressive disciplinary actions for more than four tardy incidents in a 60-day time period will include the following: 9. First verbal warning. 10. Second verbal warning. 11. Written warning. 12. First loss of vacation time accrued within the current pay period. 13. Second loss of vacation time accrued within the current pay period. 14. Review by CEO, Human Resources Director, and immediate supervisor, with employee placed in a 60-day conditional period. As stated in Section 9.2 Progressive Discipline, during the conditional period, the employee will receive full salary and benefits. If the problem is not corrected during the conditional period, employment may be terminated. If, after a successful conditional period the problem reoccurs, the employee may be terminated. 15. Temporary suspension. As stated in Section 9.2 Progressive Discipline, an employee may be temporarily suspended or permanently dismissed for the following reasons, including but not limited to, poor job performance or failure to comply with the policies and procedures of Esperanza. This is a time without pay and all accrual of benefit time will also be suspended. 16. Decision by CEO, Human Resources Director, and immediate supervisor whether to continue to employ or dismiss the employee. As stated in Section 9.2 Progressive Discipline, an employee may be dismissed at any time, including just cause as discussed in Rules of Conduct. Dismissal will be effective immediately.

Progressive discipline related to tardiness at any level can be reversed by one step if the employee has no tardy warnings in a twelve month period from the date of the most recent warning. The reversal is made at the discretion of the Human Resources Director and the employee’s supervisor. The Director of Human Resources and the employee’s supervisor will review all tardy disciplines to confirm if a reversal is warranted. 

Esperanza expects employees to use designated time as scheduled by their department supervisor to eat lunch and take breaks.  Non-exempt hourly full time employees are entitled to a one-hour lunch break. One-half of the lunch break is paid break time and the other half is unpaid time.  Non-exempt salaried full time employees receive a half hour lunch break, which is unpaid.  Exempt employees receive a half-hour lunch break, which is unpaid. Employees are not required to log off the time clock for lunches or breaks. Employees are not allowed to eat breakfast on work time unless approval from a supervisor is granted.
Esperanza uses time clocks and, for some departments, time sheets to ensure the accuracy and completeness of employee time records and to calculate benefits. Time clocks are located at various entrances at each facility. All employees are expected to clock in upon arrival for work and clock out when leaving at the end of the scheduled work period, using their access cards or their card identification number. Onsite employees are not permitted to clock in through the ADP mobile App, laptops or computers. Only employees working remotely will be permitted to clock in using the ADP mobile App with written permission from their supervisor. This privilege can be revoked at any time. No employee will clock in or out for another employee, permit another employee to sign his or her time sheet, or in any manner falsify a time record. Failure to comply with this procedure may result in disciplinary action up to termination. In the event that an employee is absent at the end of a pay period, either the employee’s supervisor or the Human Resources Department has the right to document paid leave time (i.e., sick, vacation, etc.) on behalf of the employee. Supervisors are required to review and approve their department’s staff time sheets by 9:30 am the Monday after the pay period ends. Any errors or corrections identified after the payroll is processed must be given to the Human Resources Department in writing. The correction will be processed during the next payroll.

All employees must clock out if they have a personal medical or dental appointment, including an appointment with a clinician at Esperanza. Employee requests for time away from work for personal appointments should be given to the supervisor with as much advance notice as possible. Approval to attend the appointment will depend upon adequate coverage for the employee’s position unless the medical or dental need warrants emergency treatment. If the appointment and time away from work is approved, the time spent should be reflected in the employee’s timesheet. Following the appointment, the employee should clock back in upon return to work.

Esperanza does not allow children at work except under extenuating circumstances and with the approval of the CEO or Human Resources Director. Children of Esperanza employees must be accompanied by an adult at all times while at Esperanza. Employees can use sick time or vacation, when appropriate, if they choose to be the adult accompanying the child (for example, for a visit with a medical or dental care provider). 

Holidays Esperanza observes a number of holidays for the benefit of its employees. Each full-time employee (0.8 FTE and above) is entitled to several paid holidays. In the event that a holiday falls on an employee’s normal day off, the full-time employee will be eligible for holiday pay. Part-time employees (anything under 32 hours is Part-Time), will receive holiday pay only if the holiday is observed on their regularly scheduled work day. The following holidays are observed:  New Year’s Day.  Martin Luther King, Jr. Day, Good Friday, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor Day, Thanksgiving, Christmas Eve (1/2 day) - only if this falls on a Monday through Friday, Christmas Day.

Any employee who leaves employment with Esperanza is not entitled to receive pay for any unused personal days or holidays. Personal Day Eligible employees (0.6 FTE and above) also receive one paid personal day. A non-accrued personal day is defined as hours equal to a day of work for their position and is paid time off that is not taken for sickness. A personal day can be scheduled or unscheduled, but scheduled is highly preferred. Usage of the personal day is limited to one year following the employee’s anniversary date and does not carry over into the next anniversary year. If unused, it will replace a vacation day retroactively. A personal day can be taken in one hour increments.

Esperanza provides vacation time each calendar year for all eligible employees. Employees who work 24 hours or more a week are eligible to accrue vacation hours. Vacation accrual rate is based upon job classification and length of service.  Employees who work less than 40 hours per week will accrue vacation time at a rate proportionate to their employment status and hours scheduled to work.  Employees regularly scheduled to work less than 24 hours per week are permitted to make up time they were absent from their regular work week as long as the make-up hours are completed within the same pay period, with prior approval of their supervisor. Vacation time must be taken in at least 15 minute increments. Scheduling of vacations is subject to the approval of the employee’s supervisor, and to the need of employee and staff coverage in the various departments. Requests for vacation time off will be considered based upon a variety of factors such as employee seniority, adequate staffing coverage, order in which vacation requests are made to the supervisor, and employee preferences. Vacation leave is accrued from the date of hire and will be available upon completion of the probationary period. Employees may carry forward unused vacation leave time for a maximum of two years accrual. Except under special circumstances approved in advance by the CEO, there will be no advances of accrued leave (see sick leave). Employees cannot receive additional payment in lieu of vacation. Employees who work less than 24 hours a week and temporary employees do not accrue paid vacation hours; however, they can be approved for unpaid vacation proportionate to that of a full-time employee in the same position. Requests and approval of unpaid vacation follow the same request and approval procedures of paid benefit time. If the employee exceeds the allotment of unpaid time off days, he or she may receive disciplinary action. 

Non-exempt hourly employees who have worked for 1-2 years get 80 hours of vacation time per year, 100 hours when they work for 3-5 years, 120 hours when working from 6-10 years, and 160 hours after working for 11 or more years.

Managers, Directors, and Providers receive 160 hours of vacation time per year when they work for 1-5 years, 180 hours of vacation time after working 6-7 years, and 200 hours after working for 8 or more years.

Exempt Employees, such as administrators and any other salaried employees that are not managers, directors, or providers receive 120 hours of vacation time per year when they work for 1-5 years, 140 hours when they work for 6-7 years, 160 hours when they work for 8-15 years, and 176 hours after working for 16 or more years. 

Esperanza provides sick paid time off (leave) for employees to care for themselves and their family while they are sick. Employees who work at least 40 hours per year are eligible to accrue hours of sick paid time off proportional to the hours they are scheduled to work. Employees who work less than 24 hours a week and work at least 40 hours a year will accrue sick time proportionate to that of a full-time employee in the same position. New employees are not eligible to use sick paid time off until their probationary period is completed. Temporary or seasonal employees are eligible for prorated sick paid time off, per Philadelphia’s “Promoting Health Families and Workplaces” sick leave law.

Sick paid time off is accrued from the date of hire to a maximum of seven days per year. Employees may carry forward unused sick paid time off for a maximum of 12 weeks total accrual.

Sick paid time off is to be used by eligible employees for the following approved circumstances: 1) to care for or seek treatment for their medical condition or sickness; 2) to care for or seek treatment for a family member’s medical condition or sickness; 3) to seek preventative healthcare such as routine doctor or dentist appointments, and 4) to care for themselves and family members and seek treatment, relocation, or legal services to address issues related to domestic violence, sexual assault and stalking incidents. Esperanza allows eligible employees to use sick paid time off to care for or seek treatment for the following individuals: employee, child, spouse (husband or wife by marriage; does not include “significant other”), foster child, stepchild, in-law relationships, parent, grandparent, grandchild, and siblings and child of any age incapable of self-care because of mental or physical disability.

Esperanza recognizes recuperation from childbirth as an approved circumstance for using sick paid time off for the employee birth mother and for the employee birth father caring for his wife during her recuperation period. Eligible employees may use up to one year of sick days (seven days) for continuous leave for this purpose. Eligible employees requiring additional time may request FMLA leave, if they are not already on an approved FMLA leave, or Maternity or Paternity Leave (Section 6.6), if ineligible for FMLA leave. 

The sick leave may not be used in lieu of using vacation paid time off or a personal day for purposes not included in the preceding section, Approved Circumstances for Using Sick Paid Time Off. Employees may not use sick leave for visiting individuals in the hospital, nursing facility, or other care facility.

When an employee’s sick leave lasts for three or more days, the employee may be required to provide medical documentation of the employee’s or the patient’s medical condition. When an employee’s sick leave for his/her own medical condition lasts for four or more days, the employee may be required to provide a doctor’s release to return to work. When an employee’s sick leave lasts for a minimum of five days, eligible employees must be placed on FMLA leave or Medical or Personal Leave (6.8). As noted above, employees are limited to seven days of paid sick time off for a continuous leave for the purpose of caring for self or spouse during recuperation from childbirth.

Unplanned: Calling In for Sick Leave: Call in procedures are described in Section 5.2., Attendance and Tardiness.  Planned: Requesting Sick Leave for Preventative Care: Employees are required to request leave for preventative doctor visits in advance with their supervisor and are encouraged to make preventive doctor visits during non-work hours if possible.  Planned: Requesting Continuous Sick Leave Related to Childbirth: Employees are required to request a continuous leave for their own or their wife’s recuperation from childbirth in advance with their supervisor. 

Medical documentation is generally required if an employee takes sick time the day before or after a holiday. If sufficient documentation or context for being absent is not provided, the employee may not be paid for the holiday. A medical leave certificate signed by a physician may be requested at any time following an absence for medical reasons, especially when sick leave is taken immediately before or after a holiday or vacation and/or an employee has been counseled regarding excessive absence. 

Employees who need to take sick leave in an amount greater than what they have currently accrued will be given a one-time grace occurrence and not be disciplined. Each employee is allowed one grace occurrence during the duration of employment at Esperanza. The one-time grace occurrence is time off without pay. Following the one-time grace occurrence, if an employee fails to have sufficient accrued sick time to account for absences, he or she may be subject to disciplinary actions. Employees who are on workers compensation leave and who do not have adequate benefit time to cover the waiting period may request an advance of sick time accrual from Human Resources, up to a max of seven days, to cover the first seven days of workers’ compensation leave. 

Esperanza provides full time and part time employees with paid bereavement leave to attend a funeral and mourn the recent death of relative, as follows: Parents, parent-in-law, spouse, child, step child, sibling, sibling-in-law, grandchild or grandparent will warrant 5 days for full time and 3 days for part time employees.

Aunt, uncle, cousin, niece or nephew, son-in-law, daughter-in-law will warrant 1 day of leave for full and part time employees.

An employee must request permission from his or her supervisor before taking bereavement leave, and these requests will generally be accommodated. Bereavement leave must be taken around the time of death (within 10 days) and may not be taken at a later time. Employees should be prepared to provide a funeral announcement or some formal written communication that demonstrates the reason for the bereavement leave. Employees needing to extend their bereavement leave should refer to Section 6.8 Medical and Personal Leave.

Esperanza will excuse employees from their work duties during a workday when they are called to jury duty or subpoenaed to witness duty. Witness duty includes the duty to attend court as a victim of, or a witness to, a crime or as a member of a victim’s family. The notice to report to jury duty or witness duty must be submitted to the employee’s supervisor immediately after receipt of the notice. Esperanza will compensate employees at the regular straight time rate while they are on jury duty or witness duty. To receive compensation for time away from work, employees must submit documentation provided by the court for each day of jury duty or witness duty. Any compensation paid to the employee by the court must be reimbursed to Esperanza. If the employee fails to provide documented proof of jury duty or witness duty participation, Esperanza will conclude that the absence is a paid leave and deduct the time away from work from the employee’s accrued vacation time. If the employee has no paid vacation time accrued, the time off for jury duty will be unpaid if no documentation is submitted.  

Esperanza encourages maternity or paternity leave for employees to care for the birth of a newborn child, as follows:  All employees, whether male or female, will receive one day of paid leave for the birth of their child.  Employees who work 32 hours or more per week and who are in their first year of employment at Esperanza and are therefore not eligible for leave provided under the Family Medical Leave Act (FMLA) will be eligible for maternity/paternity leave, as described in the following sections. Esperanza will allow the use of up to seven days of paid sick time off for a continuous leave for the purpose of caring for self or spouse during recuperation from childbirth. Paid sick leave will be used as described in Section 6.3, Sick Leave. Esperanza will provide up to 12 weeks of maternity or paternity leave to employees working 32 hours or more per week and who are not yet eligible for the leave provided under the FMLA, and who have completed their 90-day probationary period. Paid sick leave will be used as described in Section 6.3, Sick Leave. As noted in Section 6.3, Sick Leave, employees are limited to seven days of paid sick time off for a continuous leave for the purpose of caring for self or spouse during recuperations from childbirth. All remaining time taken during the 12 weeks will be covered by the employee’s accrued paid sick time, vacation time off or personal day, and then will be unpaid time off. The employee on maternity or paternity leave will qualify for health insurance so long as the employee continues to pay the employee portion of the health insurance premium during the unpaid time off. Insurance coverage may be terminated if the employee does not pay the employee’s portion of the health insurance premium.

In the event that both parents are employed by Esperanza, the 12 weeks of leave will be shared between the two. Esperanza will provide 12 weeks of maternity or paternity leave to employees who are in their 90 day probationary period, but they are not entitled to use their paid time off until they have completed their 90 day probationary period. The 12 weeks of maternity or paternity leave will be unpaid, but the employee will still receive the maternity/paternity one day paid leave.

In compliance with the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 (FMLA), as amended, regular full- and part-time employees may be permitted to take a leave of absence to care for family and medical needs. Esperanza will grant up to 12 weeks of leave (or up to 26 weeks of military caregiver leave to care for a covered service member with a serious injury or illness) during a 12-month period to eligible employees. FMLA provides employees with up to 12 weeks (or 26 weeks) of unpaid job protected leave per year to care for family and medical needs. The leave may be paid, unpaid or a combination of paid and unpaid leave, depending on the circumstances of the leave and as specified in this policy. To qualify to take family or medical leave under this policy, the employee must meet all of the following conditions: 1. The employee must have worked for Esperanza for 12 months or 52 weeks. The 12 months or 52 weeks need not have been consecutive. Separate periods of employment will be counted, provided that the break in service does not exceed seven years. Separate periods of employment will be counted if the break in service exceeds seven years due to National Guard or Reserve military service obligations or when there is a written agreement, stating Esperanza’s intention to rehire the employee after the service break. For eligibility purposes, an employee will be considered to have been employed for an entire week, even if the employee worked only part of a week. 2. The employee must have worked at least 1,250 hours during the 12-month period immediately before the date when the leave is requested to begin. To qualify as FMLA leave under this policy, the employee must be taking leave for one of the reasons listed below:  Twelve weeks of leave to cover the following conditions: 1. The birth of a child and in order to bond and care for that child. Shared between parents if both are employed by Esperanza. 2. The placement of a child for adoption or foster care and to care for the newly placed child. Shared between parents if both are employed by Esperanza. 3. To care for a spouse, child or parent (shared between spouses if both employed by Esperanza) with a serious health condition (described below). 4. The serious health condition (described below) of the employee. 5. Any qualifying exigency arising out of the fact that the employee’s spouse, son, daughter, or parent is a covered military member on “covered active duty.” 

Twenty-six weeks of leave during a 12 month period to care for the covered service member with a serious injury or illness if the eligible employee is the service member’s spouse, son, daughter, parent, or next of kin (military caregiver leave).

An employee may take leave because of a serious health condition that makes the employee unable to perform the functions of the employee's position. A serious health condition is defined as a condition that requires inpatient care at a hospital, hospice or residential medical care facility, including any period of incapacity or any subsequent treatment in connection with such inpatient care or a condition that requires continuing care by a licensed health care provider. This policy covers illnesses of a serious and long-term nature, resulting in recurring or lengthy absences. Generally, a chronic or long-term health condition that would result in a period of three consecutive days of incapacity, with the first visit to the health care provider within seven days of the onset of the incapacity and a second visit within 30 days of the incapacity, would be considered a serious health condition. For chronic conditions requiring periodic health care visits for treatment, such visits must take place at least twice a year. Employees with questions about what illnesses are covered under this FMLA policy or under Esperanza’s sick leave policy are encouraged to consult with the Human Resources Director. 

Child - includes natural, adopted, foster, stepchild, and ward  Age - under age 18 or any age incapable of self-care because of mental or physical disability  Spouse - husband or wife by marriage; does not include “significant other”  Parent - includes natural parent or any person standing or acting as the parent when the employee is the son or daughter  Serious Health Condition - illness, injury, impairment, physical or mental condition that requires in-patient care in a hospital, hospice or residential medical facility or continuing treatment by a health care provider Eligible employees who are away from work for five days (excluding scheduled vacation and up to seven days of leave related to recuperation from childbirth) must be placed on Family and Medical Leave status. The leave of absence may be with or without pay depending on whether the employee has unused paid time off accrued, including paid sick, vacation and personal day. Employees who are taking leave for their own serious health condition or for the serious health condition of an eligible family member will be required to use sick paid time off, personal day, and accrued vacation in that order before the unpaid portion of the leave begins. Sick time can only be used as outlined in the Section 6.3, Sick Leave. Employees must give 30 days’ advance notice with the FMLA Request Form for a foreseeable family or medical leave. If FMLA leave is needed unexpectedly, notice must be given as soon as is practical. Esperanza requires certification from the health care provider regarding the serious health condition within 15 days. Employees under FMLA are required to report periodically on their status and intention to return to work. Esperanza calculates a 12 week period using a rolling year. This includes the 12-month period beginning from the start of the initial FMLA leave.

Esperanza will continue health insurance under the same conditions as if the employee were working. Employees are required to continue contributing their health insurance premium amount and any contributions to a Health Savings Account (HSA), and/or Flexible Spending Account (FSA), and any voluntary benefits, if applicable, to ensure that coverage continues during FMLA leave. Upon return from leave, an employee will be restored to his or her former position or to an equivalent position with equivalent employment benefits, pay and other terms and conditions of employment. Paid time off benefits (vacation, sick and personal time) will not accrue during the unpaid portion of this leave. Upon return to work, the employee’s hire date and service time may be adjusted to reflect the period of time equal to the length of the leave. An employee who does not return from a leave of absence or who refuses a position upon return from a leave will be considered to have voluntarily terminated employment with the health center. If an employee terminates employment during or after a leave of absence, the employee will be informed of his or her COBRA rights for the continuation of health care benefits. The employee will be liable for any unpaid employee portion of the health insurance premiums through the day employment was terminated. Once an employee is termed out of EHC health insurance, they will receive a letter in the mail about their COBRA rights. Employees may call HRA Administrators at 610-774-9900 if they have any questions. The Human Resources Director is responsible for ensuring compliance with this policy and the FMLA. Any questions regarding the provisions of this policy should be directed to the Human Resources Director. 

A leave of absence without pay may be granted under certain or unusual circumstances. Medical or personal leaves of absence are not to exceed six months. Requests for such leave should be made at least three months in advance whenever possible and must be approved in advance in all cases. The employee must notify his or her supervisor of the leave request followed by a written request to the Human Resources Director. Approval of the leave request will be made at the discretion of the Director of HR or the CEO. During any authorized leave of absence, employees will have the option of continuing their health insurance coverage by paying the entire premium (employee and EHC portions of the premium). All earned, unused vacation, personal day, and sick leave can only be used if the leave is for medical purposes (if applicable). Paid time off will be paid out until paid time has been exhausted. After an extended approved leave of absence, the employee’s hire date may be adjusted to reflect the period of time equal to the length of the leave.

Failure to return at the end of an approved period of unpaid leave is likely to result in termination of employment. Employees who take an unpaid leave of absence beyond 30 days cannot be guaranteed that their position will be held for them. If the position is not held for them, they may apply for an open position meeting the individual’s qualifications and experience and Esperanza’s needs, at the new position’s rate of pay.

Esperanza provides leave for employees to permit them to fulfill their patriotic duties. Military leave is provided for employees who are enlisted or called to active duty and who are covered by the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act of 1996 (USERRA), which applies to persons who serve or have served in the Armed Forces, Reserves, National Guard or other “uniformed services.” Esperanza grants employees working 32 hours or more to a maximum of 15 working days leave per year for required annual training in the National Guard or U.S. military reserves. Esperanza will pay the difference between the employee’s regular wages or salary and the military pay received by the employee. If an employee is required to serve longer than 15 days in any calendar year, no supplemental pay will be granted. Additional time off needed may be negotiated as a leave of absence without pay (see Medical or Personal Leave Policy). Employees requesting military leave must notify their supervisor as soon as possible, as well as submit a copy of their military orders to their supervisor and Human Resources department to include in their personnel file.

Esperanza desires to invest in employee rest, development and renewal after the employee has completed seven years of continuous employment by offering eligible employees a four-week sabbatical. Sabbatical time is commensurate with the employee’s full-time equivalent (FTE) status (i.e., if an employee works as a 0.4 FTE, then the employee would be given a four-week sabbatical and Esperanza would pay the employee their normal 0.4 FTE salary during that time period). Sabbaticals are given in addition to the regular employee vacation allotment. Esperanza will pay for its portion of health benefits and the employee continues to pay for his or her portion. A submission of the Sabbatical Leave form must be submitted to the employee’s supervisor at least three months prior to the start of the sabbatical and forwarded to Human Resources Director for final approval. The specific dates of the sabbatical will be determined with the approval of the employee’s department supervisor. Requests for additional vacation time added onto the sabbatical time are not typically granted. If a holiday occurs during the employee sabbatical, this is considered part of the four- week sabbatical period and the sabbatical is not extended due to the holiday.

Since Esperanza invests in sabbatical time for employee development, Esperanza expects that employees will stay at least one year after the last day of their sabbatical so that the impact of the sabbatical for the employee can be shared organizationally.

Esperanza offers health and dental group insurance benefits, life insurance coverage including Accidental Death & Dismemberment (AD&D) and Long-Term Disability benefits to all full-time permanent staff and employees who work 24 hours or more a week. Health insurance coverage for dependent children, up to age 26, is provided as an option for employees who are scheduled to work a minimum of 30 hours per week. Dental insurance is offered for the employee and dependent children, up to age 19. Spousal coverage may be available with Esperanza, depending on the spouse’s employment status and eligibility for employer benefits, as verified by the Human Resources Department of the spouse’s employer. New employees must enroll in both the health and dental insurance within 30 days of hire date or wait until the next open enrollment period (currently May-June for the July 1 effective date). Employees will be responsible to pay an annually predetermined portion of the insurance premiums, based on enrollment options for employee and dependent coverage. Esperanza will cover its portion of the health insurance costs for all full-time employees as of the date of hire and/or enrollment date for health insurance. Health and dental insurance options will be explained during the new employee orientation and enrollment forms to be completed by the employee will be provided. If the employee enrolls in health and dental coverage, payment of the employee’s portion of the premiums will be taken as a payroll deduction each pay period. Esperanza currently has a high-deductible health insurance plan. There are several options to help employees pay for expenses before reaching the deductible limit. Employees have the option of enrolling in either a Health Reimbursement Account (HRA) or a Health Savings Account (HSA) at the time of enrollment. Enrollment in a Health Savings Account (HSA) is only available during open enrollment. If an employee leaves Esperanza, then is rehired within the same year, the employee will only be eligible to enroll in an HRA, regardless of having an HSA that same plan year. That employee may choose an HSA during the open enrollment period. Employees are limited to the annual contribution limit for the plan year. Esperanza also provides employees with reimbursement of Network coinsurance amounts through a Catastrophic fund (CAT). Detailed information on plan benefits, deductibles, co-insurance and reimbursement claim forms for these accounts will be given to the employee at orientation or at open enrollment.

Employees have the option of enrolling in a Flexible Saving Account (FSA) or limited FSA, at their own expense, to cover qualified medical and dental related expenses not covered by the insurance. Enrollment in the FSA must be completed within 30 days of hire or the employee must wait until the next open enrollment period, as above. Esperanza provides, at no cost to the employee, term life insurance equal to his or her annual salary (up to $100,000), Accidental Death and Dismemberment insurance (AD&D) and Long Term Disability (LTD) benefits. Eligible employees can receive benefits up and through the last day worked. Medical and dental group insurance benefits, life insurance coverage including AD&D and LTD benefits for the employee and his or her dependents will end on the day that employment is terminated. The employee may be eligible to enroll in COBRA continuation coverage to continue health and dental insurance coverage for themselves and/or previously enrolled dependents, at their own expense. Details, enrollment options, forms and cost will be discussed with the employee upon termination of employment by the Human Resources department. 

Esperanza offers retirement plan benefits through a voluntary 401(k) Savings Plan. Esperanza has established the Esperanza Health Center 401(k) Savings Plan (the “Plan”) for the benefit of its eligible employees. The Plan provides eligible employees with a way to save for retirement on a pre-tax basis, and also provides for employer matching contributions and profit-sharing contributions for eligible participants. When employees choose to participate in the Plan, a Summary Plan Description is provided to answer the employees’ questions about the Plan. Please see the benefits plan administrator when eligible. You can register for access to the 401K by going to www.mykplan.com. The summary explains who administers the Plan, how the Plan is structured, and describes the employees’ rights and benefits under the Plan. If there is any conflict between this summary and the official Plan document, the actual text of the Plan will govern all matters. A copy of the Plan is on file at Esperanza’s principal office, 4417 North 6th Street, Philadelphia PA 19140, where the employee may inspect it during regular working hours. In addition, an employee can make a written request to his or her manager, and a copy of the Plan will be made available for the employee to read. Employees must earn a “Year of Eligibility Service” to be eligible for matching and profit-sharing contributions. Currently Esperanza will match up to 3% of an employee’s own personal contributions to the Plan. Profit-sharing contributions are decided upon in each fiscal year budget. Employees will earn a Year of Eligibility Service for the 12-month period beginning on the first day they work for Esperanza if they complete at least 700 hours of service during that period. Otherwise, employees will earn a Year of Eligibility Service when they complete at least 700 hours of service during a Plan Year (the 12-month period beginning July 1 and ending the next June 30). Employees’ Year of Eligibility Service is credited at the end of the 12-month period or Plan Year in which they complete 700 hours of service.

If employees are eligible to participate in the Plan, they will become eligible for matching and profit-sharing contributions on the first day of the month after they complete a Year of Eligibility Service. If an employee leaves and returns to EHC, they do not have to wait a year to be eligible for matching if the year was completed upon their first stint with the organization. For example, if the employee was hired on March 1, 2016, and completes at least 700 hours of service during the first 12 months of employment, the employee would be credited with a Year of Eligibility Service on February 28, 2017 (the last day of the 12-month period), and would be eligible for matching and profit-sharing contributions on April 1, 2017 (the first day of the next month). Employees’ pay received before April 1, 2017, would not be counted in determining the amount of the matching or profit-sharing contributions. 

Esperanza provides malpractice insurance under the Federal Torts Claims Act (FTCA) for all licensed clinicians including medical, dental, behavioral health, nurses, and dieticians and clinical support staff (i.e., medical and dental assistants). Under Section 224 of the Public Health Service Act, as amended by the Federally Supported Health Centers Assistance Act of 1992 and 1995, employees of eligible health centers may be deemed to be federal employees qualified for protection under the FTCA, and the coverage provides immunity from medical malpractice lawsuits resulting from the performance of medical, surgical, dental, or related functions within Esperanza’s federally-approved scope of project. Esperanza maintains this coverage through an annual renewal process that includes a review of the Center’s risk management and quality assurance procedures. The FTCA coverage is comparable to an “occurrence” policy without a monetary cap. It provides liability coverage for damage or personal injury, including death, resulting from the performance of medical, surgical, dental, or related functions by Esperanza employees, while acting within the scope of their employment with Esperanza. The FTCA coverage does not extend to a clinician’s activities outside the scope of employment with Esperanza, to a practice area for which the clinician does not have a license or has not been granted clinical privileges by the Board of Directors, or to health center volunteers. All claims are filed against the United States Government and are reviewed and/or litigated by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Office of the General Counsel and the Department of Justice according to FTCA requirements. 

Esperanza may require employees to attend business related functions or activities to enhance employee performance to maintain professional licensures away from the office. Esperanza will pay the total or partial expenses of overnight travel, which include the cost of transportation (counting ground transportation fees), meals, lodging, and registration fees, as allowed by budget. Travel reimbursements considered for approval of business activities include business meetings, conferences, seminars, conventions, and selected educational functions which must be approved by the employee’s supervisor and CEO before attending. Prior to travel, the employee must submit a Request for Expense Reimbursement form to the Executive Administrator in which his or her estimated expenses are delineated. If an employee makes his or her own travel reservations, he or she is expected to travel coach or economy class. No financial commitments should be made until approval is obtained. If an employee chooses to use his or her personal vehicle, Esperanza will reimburse the employee at the standard federal travel mileage reimbursement rate in effect on the date of travel and will pay any tolls and parking. Toll and parking receipts must be provided. Esperanza will pay registration fees and lodging costs, but it is typically up to the employee to make accommodation arrangements. Esperanza will reimburse employees the sum of actual expenses incurred for up to $40 per diem for meals and miscellaneous expenses. Given the nature of our mission, simplicity and modesty in travel accommodations, meals and other expenses should be considered, and expenses kept to a minimum. For one-day travel, only parking, tolls and mileage expenses are reimbursable with a receipt and the approval of a department supervisor. Meals are generally not reimbursable for one-day travel. Volunteers may also be reimbursed for mileage at the standard federal travel mileage reimbursement rate per mile if traveling from Esperanza to a location other than their home for an assignment given by the volunteer’s supervisor. (For example, a volunteer bank courier may receive reimbursement for travel between Esperanza and the bank.)

Esperanza offers tuition reimbursement for educational development; this benefit is available to employees who work 32 hours or more per week and who have completed one year of service. The tuition reimbursement program will subsidize the cost for employees to obtain relevant coursework for their employment. Esperanza will reimburse eligible employees for tuition expenses (not including fees, books or supplies) paid to accredited schools, colleges and universities, as set forth in this policy. The provision of this assistance is discretionary, based on the criteria listed below. All classes or academic programs are subject to the supervisor’s approval; employees must complete and submit the Tuition Application Form to their supervisor for approval before enrollment in each class. The supervisor will submit the form to the Human Resources Department for approval. Classes or academic programs must relate to the nature of the employee’s job or role related to general functions of Esperanza. Employees who receive tuition reimbursement are expected to continue their employment with Esperanza for at least one year following a payment. If the employee is not employed when the course is completed, the employee is not eligible for reimbursement. The following criteria and procedures apply to participants in this program: Coursework Eligibility  Eligible classes are generally limited to those that lead toward commonly recognized degrees, such as associates, bachelors, or masters, or towards directly relevant certifications.  Courses must be directly related to the employee's current job, an advanced position within the organization, or an identifiable career path within the organization to qualify for reimbursement. Classes must not interfere with an employee's normal work schedule. Approved Programs & Courses 1.Degree Programs: Tuition reimbursement is available for associates, bachelors or other graduate degree programs. Colleges or universities must be accredited by an accrediting agency that is recognized by the U.S. Secretary of Education. An up-to-date list is available on the U.S. Department of Education’s website. Coursework completed through online classes and online degrees are not eligible for reimbursement unless approved by the Director of Human Resources and the CEO. 2.Non-Degree Programs: Individual classes outside of a degree program will be reviewed for approval on a case-by-case basis and are restricted to courses that are directly related to an employee’s present position or to prepare for another specific position in the company. Courses that meet these criteria, but are not clearly work-related may be denied for reimbursement. A preparatory class intended solely to prepare the student for an examination or certification will not typically be covered under the tuition reimbursement program. Professional certification must be in a specific job-related field of professional discipline, and should provide the participating employee with skills, knowledge and competencies applicable to their current position. 3. Scheduling of Classes: Classes must be scheduled at times that do not conflict with work assignments to be eligible for reimbursement. Employees are encouraged to review scheduling needs with their supervisor.

Approval must be obtained for any degree program and for each non-degree course, before the employee registers for the course, as follows:  To apply for reimbursement for a degree program, employees should complete a Program Approval Application, obtain their supervisor’s approval, and submit the completed form along with material describing the program and course(s) to Human Resources. The decision to support or deny a request will be made by the Human Resources Director or the CEO.

Following the review of the employee’s application for participation, the Human Resources Director will notify the employee in writing as to whether the application has been approved. Upon written confirmation of approval, the employee must submit the following items at the beginning of each term:  Request for Reimbursement of Tuition, approved by the employee’s supervisor, for any class (es) that the employee plans to take in that term.  Copy of the course syllabus.  To apply for reimbursement for a non-degree program or course, the employee should complete and submit the Request for Reimbursement of Tuition to their supervisor, along with a copy of the course syllabus. The approved request and syllabus will then be forwarded to Human Resources for approval.  Within 30 days of completion of each course, the employee should submit copies of the following documents to Human Resources to receive reimbursement:  Final Grade report  Receipt of tuition paid by the employee to the educational institution Reimbursement  Esperanza will provide matching financial support up to a 2:1 basis ($2 in Esperanza matching funds for every $1 of staff contribution).  Esperanza’s maximum contribution is $4,000 in matching funds per staff member per fiscal year, and a total of $10,000 over the course of an employee’s tenure with Esperanza.  Approved amounts are not guaranteed based on presumed eligibility by an employee. Approved amounts, if any, may be affected by an employee’s work performance, the priorities and objectives of the health center, and availability of budgeted funding for education assistance; lesser amounts than the above ratio and maximums may be approved as deemed appropriate. If You Terminate Employment:  Your eligibility for reimbursement ends immediately upon termination of employment with Esperanza, whether you have resigned voluntarily or are terminated for any reason, and regardless of whether you have completed the class or not. Payment Parameters  Tuition support will only be provided after the employee demonstrates a passing grade for the proposed classes; a passing grade being comparable to an “A,” “B,” or “C.”  Eligible expenses include only those that are verifiable and that are paid directly to an educational institution for tuition expenses or for educational loan repayment on classes that have been approved or are part of an approved program.  Reimbursement for approved courses will not be made until an employee has completed one year of service. There are no advance payments; reimbursements are made after the course is completed. Taxability  Reimbursement payments may be subject to tax and tax withholding. Employees should consult with their tax advisor.

As determined by the fiscal year budget, clinicians (i.e., physicians, physician assistants, nurse practitioners and dentists) and other professionals may receive partial or total reimbursement for professional expenses and educational activities pursued in the course of their employment. Employees working 32 hours per week or more are eligible for the full-time reimbursement. Reimbursement is proportionate to full-time employment status. The yearly reimbursement maximum is currently $2,500 for all full-time clinicians. This amount includes a subscription to the Up-To-Date online decision support and training for medical clinicians; therefore, the maximum amount available for reimbursable expenses is $2,000. Clinicians may use these funds to purchase necessary medical licenses; Drug Enforcement Agency registration; dues for membership; journal subscriptions; textbooks; and expenses related to travel, lodging and conference registration for continuing medical education. Other professional employees may have funds set aside for ongoing training and education as set aside in the fiscal year budget or approved by their supervisor and the Finance Director. To receive reimbursement for an educational or professional expense, the expense must be for Continuing Medical Education (CME) credit or other allowable professional expense. The employee must submit a Request for Expense Reimbursement form to his or her supervisor within 45 days of incurring the expense. Reimbursement will be made after the event is successfully completed. Employees who have questions about whether a professional education activity will be reimbursable should check with their supervisor before registering or paying. Esperanza reserves the right to maintain discretion to reimburse for courses that it would deem appropriate for ongoing training and development.

Esperanza serves a diverse community in North Philadelphia; Spanish is the primary language of many of the patients in Esperanza’s service area. To best serve patients in their primary language, Esperanza seeks to employ bilingual staff, who speak both English and Spanish, in positions that have direct interaction with patients. Recognizing that fluency in Spanish is not easy to find in candidates for certain professional positions, Esperanza provides support for sending either employee candidates or employees to Spanish language school. Information about support for pre-hire Spanish language training is available through the Human Resources Department. Esperanza may also provide continuing education for Spanish language training to assist employees with further development of their Spanish language skills. The employee should submit a Spanish Continuing Education Training form to his or her supervisor to request additional Spanish Language training. Employees’ Spanish language skills will be assessed by their supervisor and Human Resources to make a recommendation on the length of language training. Employees can participate in an online language training program or a local Spanish language program. All time used for continuing education training will be the employee’s personal time. Upon approval Esperanza may pay up to $500 maximum for approved continuing education language training. In extenuating cases, an employee may request a leave of absence to take time to study for language training if deemed necessary by the department supervisor. The leave of absence would be approved by the Human Resources Director and CEO. 

Esperanza maintains records for each employee, which are kept in a secure personal file in the Human Resources Department. If a staff member is also a patient of Esperanza, this information is kept separately and accessed only by those Esperanza employees who are authorized to view these records for health care purposes as outlined in the HIPAA regulations. The employee’s personnel file will contain information as is needed by Esperanza in conducting its business or as required by Federal, State or local laws. Employee personnel files are not to be accessed without permission from the Human Resources Director. Only supervisors may request access to an employee’s personnel file. Any supervisor who requests access to an employee personnel file must complete and submit a requisition form to the Human Resources Director requesting permission. This requisition form is kept on file along with all employee files to maintain a permanent written record of who has accessed employee files. Employees may schedule an appointment with the Human Resources Director to review the content of their files. Human Resources will provide information to a third party upon receipt of executed consent by the employee or in the event of a lawfully served subpoena or court order. 

Esperanza provides workers’ compensation coverage to employees as defined by the Pennsylvania Workers’ Compensation Act. In the event of an accident occurring on the job, an employee may be eligible for workers’ compensation. When a claim is approved, workers’ compensation will pay a portion of the employee’s salary or wages, following a seven-day waiting period and will also cover reasonable surgical and medical service supplies, and orthopedic prescriptions, appliances and prostheses, including training in their use. To qualify for this coverage, it is the responsibility of the employee to do the following: 1. Report the injury to his or her supervisor immediately. 2. Submit a written description of the accident by the next business day to his or her supervisor, including when and where it occurred, the nature and cause of the accident, as well as others who were present at the time. 3. Select a workers’ compensation physician from the physician panel posted on the employee bulletin board. This physician must be used for the first 90 days from the date of the first visit. 4. During that time, if the physician selected refers the employee to another licensed specialist, Esperanza’s insurer will pay the bill for these services. 5. After this 90-day period, if treatment is still necessary, the employee may choose to visit another physician or other healthcare provider. These bills will be submitted to the insurer for payment if: a.The employee notifies the administrator of his or her action in writing within five (5) days of his or her first visit to the provider of choice; AND b.The licensed physician or other healthcare provider files reports as required. These reports must be filed within 10 days after the employee’s first visit and at least once a month for as long as treatment continues. 6. If the employee is faced with a work-related medical emergency, he or she must secure emergency assistance from Temple Hospital or a panel provider physician. Upon employee submission of the employee’s written report, the employee, in conjunction with the supervisor, will complete an “Employer’s Report of Occupational Injury or Disease” (LIBC-344), and give the form to the Human Resources Director for review and follow-up. Refer to Section 6.3, Sick Leave, for information regarding the use of sick paid time off during the seven- day waiting period for Workers’ Compensation claims.

Esperanza provides limited parking for staff at the Hunting Park and Kensington sites. Kensington:  Staff may park on the lower level of the Kensington lot at H Street. Hunting Park:  Staff may park on the perimeter of the main parking lot, in the rear parking lot or the lot behind the Hunting Park building. Parking spaces in the center of the lot are designated for patient/visitor use only. Double parking or blocking another vehicle is not allowed.  Staff may get approval to park in the center of the lot under extenuating circumstances, with prior approval from the Operations Department.  In an effort to be a good neighbor, staff is encouraged to not park in front of the residences directly across from Esperanza. 5th Street Street parking availability only.

Esperanza pays employees through ADP for their work and services rendered, following the submission of a time sheet. Employees are paid on a bi-weekly pay cycle via electronic direct deposit to the employee’s checking or savings account. Electronic distribution of payroll is normally on Fridays. As required by law, Federal and State Income Tax, Social Security Taxes (FICA), Unemployment Tax, and County and City Wage Taxes (where required) are withheld from all salary and wage payments. Each employee is required to complete a W-4 form at the time of employment. Federal Income Tax is deducted from salaries and wages in accordance with the exemptions claimed on the form. Employees are required to keep their address and withholding status up-to-date. If the employee moves to a new address or wishes to change his or her withholding status (i.e., married, single, number of dependents), the employee can make the necessary changes by accessing their employee ADP account. 

Esperanza adheres to the provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) regarding overtime pay. All positions at Esperanza have been classified as either exempt or non-exempt from the overtime provision (see Policy 2.3.1, Employment Classifications). As established by the FLSA, Esperanza will pay its non-exempt employees 1.5 times their regular pay rate for work in excess of 40 hours per week, when overtime is pre-approved by their supervisor. Productive time is defined as hours spent working at Esperanza and does not include usage of leave benefits. For example, if an hourly employee works 40 hours in four days and takes a personal day, he or she will be paid for 48 hours but this will not include overtime. All overtime hours must be worked hours, not hours that are paid as a result of using sick leave, vacation, personal, or holiday time. On rare occasions, at the request of EHC, an employee may work a few hours for a department other than their home department. In this case, whatever benefits are offered to the employee for their home department position will follow them when working in a different department. For example, if an employee receives employee only health insurance, that will still be the case in the event that they work more hours for a new department.

Esperanza desires to facilitate each employee’s growth in performance and professional development. Esperanza has two periods in which performance appraisals are given: following a 90-day probationary period for all new employees, and then annually for full and part-time employees. All new employees are placed on probation for 90 calendar days following the date of hire. The probationary period provides a time for the supervisor to develop a relationship with the employee and to gain a greater understanding of both employee strengths and weaknesses. Areas in which the employee is performing well, as well as weaknesses in performance or other problematic issues, will be brought to the employee’s attention so that there can be clear communication about performance expectations. 1.Probationary Period: The 90-day probationary period is concluded with a written performance evaluation. The probationary period may be extended for a period of up to 60 days, with written explanation and specific criteria identified for improvement. Written notification of successful completion of the probationary period will be submitted to the Human Resources Director, with a copy placed in the employee’s file. All vacation and sick time will begin to accrue at the date of hire, but cannot be used until successful completion of probationary period. After completion of the probationary period, all part-time or full-time employees are eligible for one personal day per year (equivalent to one day of work for the position). 2.Performance Review: The job performance of each Esperanza employee will be evaluated annually by the employee’s immediate supervisor. Every employee will receive a formal performance review annually or within a month of their work anniversary. Additional performance reviews may be conducted at the supervisor’s discretion, due to problems such as employee work quality, tardiness, frequent absence, etc. The performance review will consist of the supervisor’s observation and judgment of the employee’s actual job performance, using the requirements in the written job description as a standard. The annual performance review is also an opportunity for the employee and supervisor to set goals for the upcoming year. A written evaluation must be signed by both the employee and the supervisor at the conclusion of each appraisal session. A copy of the performance review will be placed in the employee’s file. The employee may appeal to the Human Resources Director if he or she feels any rating is unjustified. The employee will be instructed to follow the Grievance policy and procedure.

Esperanza uses a progressive discipline policy to address employee conduct and performance issues. Any employee who violates Esperanza’s personnel policies or other organization policies or procedures is subject to progressive discipline actions. Repeated violations within a 12-month period will result in the next step in the progressive discipline process. Depending on the severity of the behavior, Esperanza can move immediately to dismissal. Disciplinary action may be taken by the CEO, senior leaders, employee supervisor, Human Resources personnel or by the Board of Directors in the instance of a complaint against the CEO, and may include any of the following actions: 1. Verbal warning. 2. Written warning. 3. Conditional Period: An employee may be placed on a conditional status for up to 60 days for reasons such as poor job performance or failure to comply with Esperanza policies and procedures. During the conditional period, the employee will receive full salary and benefits. If the problem is not corrected during the conditional period, employment may be terminated. If, after a successful conditional period the problem reoccurs, the employee may be terminated 4. Suspension: An employee may be temporarily suspended or permanently dismissed for the following reasons, including but not limited to, poor job performance or failure to comply with the policies and procedures of Esperanza. This is a time without pay and all accrual of benefit time will also be suspended. 5. Dismissal: An employee may be dismissed at any time, including just cause as discussed in Rules of Conduct. Dismissal will be effective immediately. Depending on the severity of the infraction, Esperanza maintains the right to skip any of these steps and move directly to dismissal. 

EHC seeks the highest level of ethical practices in the care of our patients and staff. We require all employees to conduct themselves with integrity, fidelity, and honesty. We also expect all employees to take responsibility for their actions and not intentionally engage in or participate in any form of malicious harm to another coworker or patient. This policy is a list of violations which may warrant disciplinary measures or dismissal. This list does not anticipate all situations that could arise and necessitate disciplinary action. Our high standard for patient care begins with our staff. The following are some (it is impossible to name every situation which would warrant discipline or dismissal) of the violations, that may result in verbal warning, written warnings, conditional status, immediate suspension, or dismissal: 1. Absence from the clinic during work hours without permission from the supervisor. 2. Insubordination. 3. Rude, disorderly, or unprofessional conduct with patients and staff. 4. Failure to perform assigned duties. 5. An unreported absence for more than three days without any communication to Esperanza is considered sufficient reason for dismissal. 6. Intentional or negligent disclosure of an Esperanza patients’ personal health information to a person or entity that is unauthorized to receive such information, under HIPAA. 7. Divulging confidential information. 8. Harassment of any kind, including sexual, racial, or religious harassment of patients or another employee. (See Section 2.10.9, Anti-Harassment) 9. Negligence or mistakes that risk the health of patients or other employees. 10. Interfering with the work performance of another employee or threatening, intimidating or coercing another employee. 11. Theft, misappropriation, or unauthorized use of property belonging to the organization, any patient, visitor, or employee. 12. Willful or careless destruction, mishandling or defacing of Esperanza equipment or property by the employee. 13. Reporting to work while chemically impaired, or possession of illegal drugs or alcohol on the property of Esperanza. 14. Knowingly falsifying records, reports, or information of any kind (i.e., falsifying time sheets or patient records). 15. Sleeping or loitering while on duty (i.e., extended and or multiple conversations unrelated to work responsibilities outside normal break period). 16. Unprofessional behavior and treatment in the care of patients. 17. Willful or careless violation of Esperanza safety, fire or security regulations. 18. Smoking in the building. 19. Lack of adherence to the patient’s right to privacy. 20. Unauthorized long distance telephone calls. 21. Unauthorized personal use of telephone or fax. 22. Repeated failure to follow the dress code (see Policy 2.10.3, Dress and Appearance). 23. Repeated failure to comply with cell phone and computer use policy (i.e., use of cell phone in clinic areas; texting or surfing the internet or using social media during work hours). 24. Unauthorized selling or soliciting on Esperanza’s premises.  25. Excessive unexcused tardiness (unexcused tardiness includes general running late; overslept; excessive lateness due to traffic). 26. Excessive coffee breaks or prolonged lunch breaks.

Esperanza maintains high standards that reflect the love of Jesus Christ. Employees are expected to conduct themselves in a professional manner. Employees are expected to follow the following rules of relationship: 1. Address the concerning issue with the respective parties. 2. Employees should notify their supervisor of presenting concerns. 3. If an employee does not feel that the concern has been properly addressed, the concern should be brought to the Human Resources Director. 4. In the best interest to honor others and maintain integrity, all concerns should be addressed with the respective parties and supervisor and not involve a third person. When conflict arises, speak directly to the person (or supervisor) before speaking to others about unresolved conflict. 5. Esperanza employees should be committed to resolving all concerns in a cordial manner and in a way that brings glory to God.

This policy is to encourage employee’s dress, hygiene and grooming in the workplace that will promote a professional image. Neat and clean dressing, grooming and identification are important to good patient care and good employee-patient relations. This policy outlines the appropriate dress attire for the employees, volunteers, students or any other person who might appear to be an employee of Esperanza. These standards are based upon a need to provide a safe, clean and therapeutic environment for patients and staff. The following list is a guideline of what attire is appropriate and inappropriate. Dress must be professional, show decency and modesty. Supervisors may set special dress or grooming requirements for their staff as necessary as it relates to the job duties and to ensure staff safety. Supervisors are responsible for the consistent enforcement of the dress code for their particular areas. Employees who are not in appropriate dress may be asked to clock out, go home and change their attire. Employees who repeatedly do not adhere to the dress code will be subject to disciplinary action.

1.Employees are expected to dress in a manner that presents a professional and neat personal appearance in accordance with their job duties. Employees should maintain normal and reasonable personal hygiene and grooming standards.2.Clothing must be suitable, clean and pressed. It should not attract undue attention.

This policy outlines the use of personal cell phones while on Esperanza premises and the use of cell phones while driving for Esperanza duties. This policy applies to both incoming and outgoing cellular calls and texts. Personal Use of Cell Phones Cell phones must be turned off or set on vibrate or silence at all times while on Esperanza premises, particularly during meetings, conferences and all other locations where incoming calls may be disruptive. Employees are not permitted to use personal cell phones during work hours to receive incoming calls, text messages or to make outgoing calls and sending text messages. Employees are asked to make personal calls or text messages on non-work time. Flexibility will be provided due to extenuating circumstances demanding immediate attention. Employees must communicate with their supervisor regarding these circumstances and get permission to make non-work related calls or texts. Employees are not allowed to have cell phones visible in clinical or other settings if dealing with the public. Employees in non-clinical areas may use cell phones to listen to music during work hours. Music should not be audible to other employees in the general work area. Employee use of personal cell phones for personal calls, texting, or internet surfing during company hours will likely become subject to disciplinary action.  

Safety Issues for Cell Phone Use: Employees whose job responsibilities include regular or occasional driving for business use are expected to refrain from using their phone while driving. Employees are encouraged to pull to the side of the road and safely stop the vehicle before placing or accepting a call. If acceptance of a call is unavoidable and pulling over is not an option, employees are expected to keep the call brief and use hands free equipment. 

Special Responsibilities for Managerial Staff and Clinicians: Employees in leadership positions are expected to serve as role models for proper compliance with the provision of above and are encouraged to regularly remind employees of their responsibilities to comply with this policy. However, Esperanza recognizes that clinicians and managers rely on their cell phones for business purposes such as accepting calls when traveling or out of the office, for calendars and schedules, for clinical purposes, etc. These purposes for cell phone use are acceptable and are reasons to use cell phones during the work day.

Esperanza provides email accounts to employees in order to facilitate Esperanza business, in compliance with Esperanza policies and local, state, and federal regulations. The standard internet email address for employees is firstname.lastname@esperanzahealth.com. 

Employees are to use Esperanza email for the purposes of conducting Esperanza business and other activities. All email correspondence remains the property of Esperanza. Sending or storing patient protected health information is strictly prohibited. Any usage in violation of Esperanza policies, local, state, or federal regulations is prohibited. The IT department or management team may review employee email accounts at any time to ensure the manner and content of email correspondence is in accordance with Esperanza policies. Examples of prohibited uses of email include, but are not limited to:  Sending patient protected health information to any internal or external email address.  Viewing, storing, soliciting, or forwarding pornographic images or other perceived obscene, racist, or harassing materials. Sending electronic mail that is obscene, racist, harassing, jokes, violent or otherwise offensive.  Solicitation, distribution or forwarding electronic games, music, video, or other nonbusiness related materials.  Solicitation, distribution or forwarding of non-work related information, such as requests for signatures, support of political activities, or requests for donations to non community based organizations.  Bidding/purchasing of merchandise or services.  Forwarding electronic chain letters.

To protect the Esperanza’s email system, incoming file attachments larger than 8 megabytes are blocked. The incoming email message will come through, but with a notation that the attachment was blocked. Individual employee exceptions to this restriction must be approved by the IT Director. Emails with attachments equal to or greater than 25 MB will be restricted by Esperanza’s email client. Employees should recognize that other email systems may block the attachments they are sending. For mobile and offsite email access, employees may access accounts from any Internet Connected computer or device via the web-mail portal. Emails will be retained indefinitely by the Esperanza’s IT department unless the storage of such emails causes disruption to services. Staff are encouraged to organize, archive, and purge emails on a regular basis to facilitate access to information. Inappropriate usage and retention of email may result in a disciplinary action.

Esperanza employees are expected to keep their work areas clean and orderly at all times. A clean and orderly work environment affects safety and patient care. Paperwork should be completed and put away at the end of the day or within the designated time frame established by a department supervisor. Papers and computer screens that have patient health information should be safeguarded at work stations at all times. All areas must be maintained in accordance with local safety and fire standards. 1. Personal photographs, signs and other personal items must be neatly kept to a minimum around the desks. At the end of the day, all work areas should be cleaned up and made ready for the next day of work. 2. All food and beverage containers in the employee’s work area are to be removed and/or properly cleaned or disposed of at the end of the day. Food should not be consumed in areas where patients are present. 3. Each employee is required to clean up after themselves in common use areas such as the kitchen.

Esperanza complies with the Drug-Free Workplace Act of 1988, and expects compliance of all its employees. The unlawful manufacture, distribution, dispensation, possession, or use of any controlled substance (illegal drugs and narcotics, alcoholic beverages) is banned in the workplace. In addition, all legal or prescription drugs which may impair an employee’s ability to perform his/her job are expressly prohibited. Violations of this policy will result in disciplinary action. Any employees who find they are experiencing a substance abuse addiction are required to disclose this to their supervisor, who will assist them in seeking the appropriate help. 

Esperanza is committed to a work environment that cultivates unity by directly addressing conflicts. This policy provides a structured system by which an employee can address concerns, complaints and grievances. This policy allows supervisors to explore remedies and resolve minor disputes at the departmental level. All other grievances should be directed to the Human Resource Department. If an employee has a question about interpretation or application of a health center policy, a disagreement with a co-worker or supervisor, or feels that he or she has been treated unfairly or has a problem that needs further resolution, the employee should take the following action with his or her Department Supervisor. The process should be started within five working days of the incident or problem giving rise to the grievance. Any grievance not raised within this period will be considered waived. 1. The employee should request a meeting with his or her Department Supervisor, specifying that the nature of the request is to discuss a grievance. 2. The Department Supervisor will:  meet with the employee at the earliest possible convenience;  document the nature of the grievance;  investigate the concerns;  seek consultation from the Human Resource Director as needed regarding any relevant labor laws;  recommend any action to be taken;  respond to the employee within five working days; and  submit a record of the grievance to Human Resources to be placed in the personnel file. 3. If the employee is not satisfied with the response of the Department Supervisor, the employee is welcome to repeat this process by contacting the Department Director, as described in Step 1, within three working days. If the employee is still not satisfied with the response of the Department Director, the employee may repeat this process, in order, with the:  Human Resources Director; CEO;  The Human Resources Committee of the Board of Directors. The Human Resources Committee of the Board of Directors will have final authority with regard to an employee’s grievance. The Board of Directors will be given a copy of all grievances.

Esperanza has established an employee complaint hotline as an additional step in the organization’s commitment to providing a workplace free of harassment, discrimination, or other practices that are in direct violation of our rules of conduct and ethical practices. When reporting to the hotline, employees will remain anonymous and a report will be sent to HR in order to address the complaint according to the guidelines established by EHC. The following concerns may be reported to the hotline:  Harassment  Discrimination  Illegal activity  Safety issues  Workplace violence  Theft, fraud To make a report, call 877-557-7419 and use reference code: 5136.

Esperanza encourages a positive work environment by maintaining a “no tolerance” policy toward harassment of any kind, including racial or sexual harassment, sexual abuse and molestation, and verbal abuse and bullying behaviors by any employee, including supervisors, managers, board members, and executives. Employees found in violation of this policy will be disciplined, up to and including termination. It is the desire of Esperanza to create, maintain, and encourage a positive work environment that allows for individual growth, creativity and productivity. We value the worth of each employee. Employees have the right to work in an environment that is free of racial, or sexual harassment, sexual abuse and molestation, and verbal abuse and bullying behaviors. Harassment becomes unlawful where 1) enduring the offensive conduct becomes a condition of continued employment, or 2) the conduct is severe or pervasive enough to create a work environment that a reasonable person would consider intimidating, hostile, or abusive. Anti-discrimination laws also prohibit harassment against individuals in retaliation for filing a discrimination charge, testifying, or participating in any way in an investigation, proceeding, or lawsuit under these laws; or opposing employment practices that they reasonably believe discriminate against individuals, in violation of these laws.

To that end, Esperanza maintains a “no tolerance” policy toward any kind of harassment including: 1. Verbal harassment, such as bullying, epithets, derogatory comments or slurs; 2. Physical harassment, such as sexual abuse and molestation, physical assault, impeding or blocking movement and other forms of bullying behaviors that interfere with normal work or movement. Sexual harassment may also include the demand for sexual favors or unwanted sexual advances that base an employment benefit or continued employment upon the exchange of sexual favors. 3. Visual harassment, such as derogatory posters, cartoons or drawings. Definitions and Examples Bullying: Esperanza defines bullying as repeated inappropriate behavior, either direct or indirect, whether verbal, physical or otherwise, conducted by one or more persons against another or others, at the place of work and/or in the course of employment. Such behavior violates Esperanza’s core values of teamwork and respect. Bullying may be intentional or unintentional. However, it must be noted that when an allegation of bullying is made, the intention of the alleged bully is irrelevant, and will not be given consideration when meeting out discipline. As in sexual harassment, it is the effect of the behavior on the individual that is important. Esperanza considers the following types of behavior examples of bullying:  Verbal bullying: Slandering, ridiculing or maligning a person or his or her family; persistent name calling that is hurtful, insulting or humiliating; using a person as butt of jokes; abusive and offensive remarks.  Physical bullying: Pushing, shoving, kicking, poking, tripping, assault or threat of physical assault, damage to a person’s work area or property  Gesture bullying: Nonverbal threatening gestures; glances that can convey threatening messages. Exclusion: Socially or physically excluding or disregarding a person in work-related activities In addition, the following examples may constitute or contribute to evidence of bullying in the workplace: 1. Persistent singling out of one person. 2. Shouting or raising voice at an individual in public or in private. 3. Using verbal or obscene gestures. 4. Not allowing a person to speak or express him- or herself (i.e., ignoring or interrupting). 5. Personal insults and use of offensive nicknames. 6. Public humiliation in any form. 7. Constant criticism on matters unrelated or minimally related to the person’s job performance or description. 8. Ignoring or interrupting an individual at meetings. 9. Public reprimands. 10. Repeatedly accusing someone of errors that cannot be documented. 11. Deliberately interfering with mail and other communications. 12. Spreading rumors and gossip regarding individuals. 13. Encouraging others to disregard a supervisor’s instructions. 14. Manipulating the ability of someone to do his or her work (e.g., overloading, under loading, withholding information, assigning meaningless tasks, setting deadlines that cannot be met, giving deliberately ambiguous instructions). 15. Inflicting menial tasks not in keeping with the normal responsibilities of the job. 16. Taking credit for another person’s ideas. 17. Refusing reasonable requests for leave in the absence of work-related reasons not to grant leave. 18. Deliberately excluding an individual or isolating him or her from work-related activities, such as meetings. 19. Unwanted physical contact, physical abuse or threats of abuse to an individual or an individual’s property (defacing or marking up property). Sexual Harassment: There are two distinct categories of sexual harassment: Quid pro quo and “hostile work environment.”  Quid pro quo sexual harassment occurs when submission to sexual conduct is required as a condition of employment. Example: Promise for promotion in exchange for sexual activity.  “Hostile work environment” sexual harassment occurs when sexual conduct has a purpose of effect of unreasonably interfering with an individual’s work performance or creating an intimidating, hostile or offensive working environment. Examples: Display of lewd photographs, rude remarks of a sexual nature, intimate contact by parties at work, and posters. Sexual Abuse and Misconduct: Sexual abuse or misconduct may include, but is not limited to:  Child sexual abuse – any sexual activity, involvement or attempt of sexual contact with a person who is a minor (under 18 years old) where consent is not or cannot be given.

Sexual activity with another who is legally incompetent or otherwise unable to give consent.  Physical assaults or violence, such as rape, sexual battery, abuse, molestation or any attempt to commit such acts.  Unwanted and intentional physical conduct that is sexual in nature, such as touching, pinching, patting, brushing, massaging someone’s neck or shoulders and/or pulling against another’s body or clothes.  Material such as pornographic or sexually explicit images, posters, calendars or objects.  Unwelcome and inappropriate sexual activities, advances, comments, innuendoes, bullying, jokes, gestures, electronic communications or messages (e.g. email, text, social media, voicemail), exploitation, exposure, leering, stalking or invasion of sexual privacy.  A sexually hostile environment characterized as comments or conduct that unreasonably interferes with one’s work performance or ability to do the job or creates an intimidating, hostile or offensive environment.  Direct or implied threats that submission to sexual advances will be a condition of employment or affiliation with the organization. Procedure for Reporting Suspected Incidents of Harassment: Immediately report suspected incidents of harassment to the Director of Human Resources or COO. You may also address the concern directly with the CEO. It is not required to directly confront the person who is the subject of the report, question or complaint before notifying a Director. Esperanza will take every reasonable measure to ensure that those named in complaint of misconduct, or are too closely associated with those involved in the complaint, will not be part of the investigative team. Anti-retaliation and False Allegations Esperanza prohibits retaliation made against any employee, volunteer, board member or any other person who lodges a good faith complaint of harassment who participates in any related investigation. Making knowingly false or malicious accusations of harassment can have serious consequences for those who are wrongly accused. Esperanza prohibits making false or malicious harassment allegations, as well as deliberately providing false information during an investigation. Anyone who violates this rule is subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment and criminal prosecution. Investigation and Follow-up Esperanza will take all allegations of harassment seriously and will promptly, thoroughly and equitably investigate whether misconduct has taken place. Esperanza may utilize an outside thirdparty to conduct an investigation of harassment. Esperanza will cooperate fully with any investigation conducted by law enforcement or other regulatory/protective services agencies. Esperanza will make every reasonable effort to keep the matters involved in the allegation as confidential as possible while still allowing for a prompt and thorough investigation. Reporting to Law Enforcement or Appropriate Child or Adult Protective Services.

Esperanza is committed to following the state and federal legal requirements for reporting allegations or incidents of sexual abuse or misconduct to appropriate law enforcement and child or adult protective services organizations. It is the policy of Esperanza not to attempt to investigate or assess the validity or credibility of an allegation of sexual or physical abuse as a condition before reporting the allegation to proper law enforcement authorities or protective services organizations.

Esperanza prohibits romantic or sexual relationships between providers or any other staff with patients that are under their direct care or service delivery. Esperanza prohibits romantic or sexual relationships between a manager or other supervisory employee and his or her staff (an employee who reports directly or indirectly to that person) because such relationships tend to create compromising conflicts of interest or the appearance of such conflicts. In addition, such a relationship may give rise to the perception by others that there is favoritism or bias in employment decisions affecting the staff employee. Moreover, given the supervisor’s power within such relationships, consent by the staff member is suspect and may be viewed by others or, at a later date, by the staff member, as having been given as the result of coercion or intimidation. The atmosphere created by such appearances of bias, favoritism, intimidation, coercion or exploitation undermines Esperanza’s mission, and the spirit of trust and mutual respect that is essential to a healthy work environment. If such a relationship develops, the parties must immediately inform the Human Resources department. Supervisory responsibility will be immediately transferred and a review for reasonable accommodation of job placement will be performed. In the event that an accommodation is unable to be made, the relationship must desist or termination of employment may occur. Mandatory reporting does not apply to employees who do not work in the same department or to parties who do not supervise or otherwise manage responsibilities over the other. Any undisclosed relationship that is discovered between a supervisor/manager and staff will lead to disciplinary action and/or termination of employment. 

This Conflict-of-Interest policy applies to all Esperanza employees, whether temporary, part-time or full-time regular, and Board Members that are involved in the selection, award, or administration of contracts that are paid for by Esperanza, through federal and/or non-federal awards. A conflict of interest is hereby defined as any situation, either at or away from Esperanza premises, which affects the ability of an employee or Board Member to act or to make a decision in the health center’s best interest. Apparent staff conflicts of interest will be resolved by the CEO and COO and disclosed to the Board of Directors. Esperanza Board Members are required to disclose any conflicts of interest, real or apparent, that might influence judgment in a decision-making process. Following disclosure, Esperanza’s Board Executive Committee will determine the appropriate action to be taken, ranging from abstaining from specific Board decisions to stepping down from membership. It is prohibited for individuals with real or apparent conflicts of interest with a given contract from participating in the selection, award, or administration of such contract. Esperanza Board Members are expected to maintain appropriate confidentiality with respect to Esperanza business and clinical matters. Certain acts must be disclosed by this policy. Employees and Board Members found to be engaging in such acts may be subject to disciplinary actions, according to the personnel policy. While this list does not include all prohibited or reportable acts, the following examples are provided: 1. Appropriating, using or permitting others to appropriate or use any funds, property or time compensated by Esperanza or any of the assets of Esperanza for personal gain or benefit or for any unlawful purpose. 2. Failing to disclose known personal interests, whether direct or indirect, in any entity with which the company does business or seeks to do business, excluding personal interests consisting solely of publicly traded securities amounting to less than five percent of the total of any one class of outstanding securities. An employee will be deemed as having an indirect interest in a business if an immediate family member of such employee has such a business interest, or if a nominee or trust controlled by the employee or one of the employee's immediate family members has such a business interest. 3. Accepting personal or business loans from entities with which the company does business, excluding loans obtained from lending institutions at prevailing interest rates, terms, and conditions. 4. Serving at any time as an incorporator, director, officer, partner, employee or consultant of any partnership, corporation, or other entity doing business or seeking to do business with Esperanza. 5. Accepting gifts, gratuities or entertainment in cash or in kind (monetary or nonmonetary) from any present or potential vendor for private financial gain from such contractors or parties to sub-agreements. Organizational Conflict by Board of Director and Administrator Leadership Participation No member of the Board of Directors of Esperanza may be an employee of Esperanza. No member of the Board or a Board committee may derive personal profit or gain, directly or indirectly, by reason of his or her membership on the Board or a Board committee. Board of Directors 1. Esperanza Health Center Bylaws: The Esperanza Health Center Bylaws further defines conflict of interest provisions for Board members. This policy is intended to supplement the provisions of the Bylaws. 2. Confidentiality: Additionally, due to the sensitive nature of some items that are dealt with at Board Meetings, Board Members are expected to refrain from discussing business from Board Meetings with outside entities without the approval of Esperanza’s Board President. Administrative Procedures 1. Annually, the Directors, CEO, management staff and other employees, as appropriate, complete a new conflict of interest disclosure form and submit it to the COO. The CEO and COO will review the forms and submit them to the Director of Human Resources for inclusion in the employee personnel file, or in the case of Board members, the disclosure form will be kept in a Board file. 2. The CEO and COO review conflict of interest forms received which indicate potential conflicts, advise employees with potential conflicts, and monitor those activities with potential conflicts as necessary, and suggest methods for mitigating or managing important conflicts as appropriate (e.g., recusal from decision-making that could give the appearance of being influenced by the potential conflict). 3. An employee who has a potential conflict of interest covered by this policy must immediately disclose the nature and extent of such interest in writing to his/her supervisor. The employee may continue participation in the transaction only on terms approved in writing by the supervisor. The CEO should declare important conflicts of interest to the president of the board or his/her designee. 4. When appropriate, the board should ensure that discussions concerning conflicts of interest appear on the agenda and in the minutes of the Board meeting(s). 5. Failure to resolve concerns related to conflicts of interest may result in disciplinary action according to the personnel policy. 6. An employee with a conflict of interest will refrain from any further participation in the discussion of such matters and refrain from any decision-making related to the conflict of interest. 

Esperanza employees may not accept or solicit, directly or indirectly, from a patient, visitor, vendor, donor or potential vendor, any goods or services that might cause or be construed to cause a conflict of interest. This prohibition includes any gift, gratuity, favor, entertainment, honorarium, loan, or any other thing of monetary value offered in the course of or as a result of current employment at Esperanza. Unsolicited advertising or promotional material such as pens, pencils, notepads, calendars, and other items of nominal intrinsic value are a limited exception to this policy. Employees can accept monetary gifts and honorariums made payable to Esperanza as long as these are immediately turned over to Esperanza for deposit.

This policy does not pertain to honoraria if they are received as a result of participation in activities outside of the distinctive vision and mission of Esperanza. The employee may not be acting within his or her role as an Esperanza employee and may not be representing Esperanza. These activities must take place off the premises of Esperanza and on the employee’s own time. The employee must direct any reimbursement to their home address. Esperanza may immediately dismiss any individuals affiliated with Esperanza who are found to have offered or accepted a bribe to secure funding or other benefits for or from Esperanza. 

Esperanza employees who engage in political activities or have contact with government officials in the course of their job are expected to abide by the following regulations for such activities. Honest Dealing with Government Officials Individuals affiliated with Esperanza should be cooperative and truthful in their dealings with any governmental inquiries or requests, including audits, surveys, and certification reviews. However, individuals affiliated with Esperanza who are not authorized to speak on behalf of the health center should not respond to any governmental inquiries or requests, including audits, surveys, and certification reviews, and must promptly report any such inquiries or requests to the Esperanza’s CEO, Compliance Officer or other member of senior management. Political Activities No individuals affiliated with Esperanza may participate or intervene in any political campaign in support of or in opposition to any candidate for elected public office while at work during business hours. A political campaign is deemed to begin when an individual announces his or her candidacy for an elective public office, or is proposed by others for an elective public office. No individuals affiliated with Esperanza may use the health center’s name, facility or any resources in connection with political campaign activities. Lobbying Lobbying is generally defined as a communication (written or oral) that is an attempt to influence (for or against) specific legislation including appropriations. Any lobbying activities proposed to be undertaken by Esperanza or by any individuals affiliated with the health center on behalf of Esperanza will require the prior approval of the CEO. Any individuals affiliated with Esperanza undertaking lobbying activities will work with the CEO, or his or her designee, to ensure that such activities are supported by non- Federal resources and to ensure that all disclosures and reporting of lobbying activities which are required by State or Federal law are submitted in a timely manner. 

Esperanza’s policy is to provide its patients with the best possible service. Employees are expected to treat patients in a courteous, respectful manner at all times. Employees should always remember that the patient comes first and is entitled to the same thoughtful treatment that the employee would like to receive. Patients should not be treated in a condescending or impolite manner and should never be kept waiting an unreasonable amount of time. When a patient approaches an employee with a question or complaint, the employee will give the matter his or her immediate attention. If a patient becomes abusive or argumentative and the employee cannot properly handle the situation, the patient should be referred to the employee’s supervisor. 

Esperanza welcomes its employees and Board members to seek medical care here. Esperanza staff and Board members who choose Esperanza for their medical health care should understand the limitations and potential for conflict of interest implicit in this choice. There are special issues to consider when a staff or Board member is cared for as a patient of Esperanza. When an Esperanza clinician sees a patient who is also a co-worker or Board member of Esperanza, the clinician and patient have two relationships with each other—one as a friend/co-worker, and the other as a clinician/patient. Because of the personal (friend/co-worker) relationship between the patient and the clinician, the clinical (clinician/patient) relationship could potentially be jeopardized, and vice versa. When caring for an Esperanza Board member as a patient, clinical staff are caring for persons who have an authority relationship over them, and this presents further opportunities for conflict of interest. Since potential for conflict of interest is unavoidable in these relationships, the following procedures are in place to assist in recognizing and managing potential conflict of interest. At the time of their first visit, the clinician will discuss these potential limitations with the Esperanza staff or board member, as follows:  Staff or Board members who may feel uncomfortable honestly answering questions about their physical, emotional, sexual, or spiritual history should consider receiving medical care outside of Esperanza.  A listing of outside primary care doctors recommended by Esperanza staff shall be available for staff members wishing to choose non-Esperanza clinicians.

Through the duration of the patient care relationship, clinicians should work towards the goal of providing care in the same way that they would do for any other non-staff/nonBoard member patient.  If at any time, either the clinician or the patient believes that their personal relationship is compromising the quality of care being delivered, these issues should be honestly and respectfully discussed. If either the clinician or patient believes that these issues cannot reasonably be resolved, then either the clinician or the patient may independently decide that care shall be provided with another provider.  Staff or Board members should preferably select clinicians with whom they work infrequently. When possible, it may be preferable for a staff member to choose a clinician working at a different Esperanza site than the staff member. It’s understandable that the convenience of working with a clinician who works from the same Esperanza site may be more important for them than seeing a clinician with whom they work infrequently.  When they have a clinical need, as much as possible, staff or Board members shall try and see their assigned primary clinician, rather than seeing another accessible clinician, even though they may have easy contact with many other Esperanza clinicians.  As would be the case for staff members being cared for by outside physicians, staff health issues should be addressed with Esperanza clinicians when they are not scheduled to work. Time off should be worked out with their supervisor. Staff members must use paid time off to schedule appointments with clinicians, as directed by Esperanza personnel policy. Staff must clock out when being evaluated by Esperanza clinicians.  Esperanza staff members should not order their own tests and should not perform testing on themselves.  Esperanza staff members should not check their own test results – their clinician should review their results with them.  Esperanza staff or Board members should not request special changes to the schedule in order to schedule an appointment for themselves. When requesting an appointment, patients and board members should request their appointment through a clerical assistant, so we are sure to follow all procedures.  Performance of breast and genital examinations on Esperanza staff or Board members should only be conducted by same-sex clinicians. Assistance of same-sex clinician colleagues is appropriately requested when staff or Board members have chosen an opposite sex clinician as their primary provider.  Clinicians must make decisions about granting time off from work due to medical reasons objectively, independent of the staff person’s supervisor. Clinicians must first advocate for their patients. Though time off plans may be discussed between the clinician and the staff person’s supervisor, supervisors must not attempt to influence decisions about time off made by the clinician.  By federal HIPAA requirements, only clinical staff caring for a given Esperanza staff or Board member will have legal access to view that patient’s medical record, and then only parts of that record which are pertinent to their task may be viewed. Personal health information must be kept confidential, and violations are prosecutable by law.

Because clinical staff are assigned to cross-cover for each other in numerous circumstances, including cross-covering across Esperanza sites, it is not possible to guarantee any given patient that any particular clinical staff member might not at some point have appropriate access to their medical record. Therefore staff or Board members who wish to protect their health information from any particular Esperanza clinical staff member will be required to choose a clinician outside of Esperanza.

Esperanza wants to ensure the safety of its employees in case of extreme weather conditions. This policy addresses actions Esperanza will use to inform staff and patients of health center closure or delayed starts due to inclement weather. The CEO and COO will confer at the earliest possible time to determine if and when the health center should be closed. The decision to close or delay opening will be finalized by 6:30 a.m. Monday through Friday and by 7:00 a.m. on Saturday. If a decision is made to delay opening or close all departments must adhere to the inclement weather protocol for their particular department. Employees will call 215-302-3151 for a recorded message regarding health center closure (after 6:30 a.m. on weekdays and after 7:30 a.m. on Saturdays) Note: If the health center will be open, and employees are unable to report to Esperanza on time because of an extenuating circumstance, the employees must speak with their supervisor (not leave a voicemail) at least one hour before the scheduled start time (or sooner if possible). Employees who are unable to work due to inclement weather must use vacation or personal time to cover any absence. 

Esperanza relies on employees and others, to identify potential compliance problems and ask questions regarding our compliance policy and practices. This policy pertains to all Esperanza employees, Board members and officers. Esperanza is committed to following all applicable laws and regulations. In particular, we are committed to comply with laws and regulations that address health care fraud, waste, and abuse and to assure the proper billing of Medicare, Medicaid, and other government-funded health care programs, as well as other payers (insurance companies or self-pay patients). No Retaliation No employee, board member or officer who in good faith reports a violation, will suffer harassment, retaliation or adverse employment consequences. An employee who retaliates against someone who has reported a violation in good faith is subject to discipline up to and including termination of employment. The intent of this policy is to encourage and allow employees or others to raise concerns within Esperanza prior to seeking resolution outside of the health center.

Compliance Investigation/Reporting Procedure Employees should share their concerns with someone who can address them properly. In most cases, an employee's supervisor is the best person to address an area of concern. However, if that is not possible or the employee is unsatisfied with the response, the employee is encouraged to speak with the Human Resources Director. Managers are required to report suspected violations to the CEO, who has specific and exclusive responsibility to investigate. If necessary, the employee should contact the CEO directly. If the CEO is suspected of violating a policy or standard business practice, then the employee should report to the Director of Human Resources who will notify the Chair of the Board of Directors of Esperanza. Accounting and Auditing Matters The Finance Committee of the Board of Directors will address all reported concerns or complaints regarding corporate accounting practices, internal controls or auditing. The CEO will immediately notify the Finance Committee of any such complaint and work with the committee until the matter is resolved. Acting in Good Faith Anyone filing a complaint concerning a suspected violation of policy, practice or activity must be acting in good faith and have reasonable grounds for believing the information disclosed indicates a violation. Any allegations which prove to have been made maliciously or knowingly to be false will be viewed as a serious disciplinary offense.

Esperanza ensures that all protected health information is handled in a confidential and appropriate manner to honor the relationship and trust with our patients and to comply with Federal regulations outlined in the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) of 1996, and the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH)as amended. Esperanza has an appointed HIPAA Compliance Committee that is charged with the development, dissemination, and ongoing management of the policies of the organization’s HIPAA compliance efforts. The Committee conducts initial and periodic training programs for all employees. Esperanza requires all staff members to complete HIPAA training, at hire and yearly thereafter. HIPAA training covers the following areas: 1.Esperanza’s Notice of Privacy Practices. 2.Esperanza’s policies for protecting patient’s personal health information. 3.Esperanza sanctions for employees who do not adhere to HIPAA related policies and procedures. Esperanza employee sanctions for violating HIPAA privacy rules are based on the degree of impact (minor or major) of the violation and the employee’s intent (negligent or intentional), as follows: 1. Negligent, minor impact: For the first infraction, the supervisor will review the HIPAA policy with the employee. For subsequent infractions of the same nature or multiple HIPAA infractions, regardless of type, disciplinary measures may be taken. Progressive discipline, if deemed necessary by the Compliance Officer, will begin at verbal or written warning. a. Negligent, minor impact examples: Leaving patient information in full view of other patients; wrong patient’s PHI disclosed to another HIPAA entity (includes wrong referral, lab slip, script, letter, form, chart copy, patient bills); scanned documents in wrong chart; PHI not disposed of properly; patient message sent attached to wrong patient chart; message or progress note contains PHI for more than one patient; PHI sent in unsecured email. 2. Negligent, major impact: The HR Director and/or Compliance team member will conduct a policy review with the employee. Progressive discipline will begin at written warning. a. Negligent, major impact example: Carelessly disclosing PHI to a non-HIPAA covered entity (i.e., a third party not authorized to receive it and not bound by HIPAA law). 3. A willful/intentional violation of the HIPAA privacy rules can be grounds for immediate dismissal and includes (but is not limited to) the following: a. Intentionally releasing medical information to a person or entity that is not authorized to access this information. b. Intentionally discussing patient information in a way that will be overheard by others. c. Intentionally accessing patient information for purposes other than patient-related clinical treatment and care. Esperanza requires that, upon termination of employment, employees maintain all patient information that was learned on the job at Esperanza, in confidence. Under no circumstances may any patient’s personal health information that was learned on the job at Esperanza be shared without the patient’s authorization. If HIPAA privacy has been violated, Esperanza requires the following actions be taken, as directed by the HIPAA Compliance Committee: 1. Identify and respond to suspected or known security incidents. 2. Mitigate, to the extent possible, harmful effects or security incidents known at the time of the incident. 3. Assess the risk of harm from the breach. If risk of harm is determined, then Esperanza will notify the patient of the breach of unsecured personal health information and document security incidents and their outcomes in an Incident Report.

Esperanza complies with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) standards for workplace safety. Esperanza has an appointed OSHA Compliance Committee that is charged with the development, dissemination, and ongoing management of the policies of the organization’s OSHA compliance efforts. The Committee conducts initial and periodic training programs for all employees who may have any occupational exposure as a result of their job. The training programs are provided during normal working hours at the time of initial assignment to tasks where occupational exposure may take place, and annually. The training program consists of the following elements and materials: 1. A copy of the OSHA standards supporting the Esperanza Health Center Exposure Control Plan. 2. A review of the Esperanza Exposure Control Plan with copies available. 3. An explanation of the OSHA standards and Esperanza Health Center Exposure Control Plan. 4. A general explanation of the epidemiology and symptoms of blood-borne diseases, specifically HIV, hepatitis A, B and C, and malaria. 5. An explanation of the modes of transmission of blood-borne pathogens. 6.

A review of appropriate actions to take in case of evacuation for fire or other emergencies.

Esperanza supports breast-feeding mothers by providing them with break time and a private area to express breast milk during the workday. Esperanza will provide reasonable accommodations to an employee to express breast milk for her nursing child for up to one year after the child’s birth. It is the responsibility of the employee to provide advance notice of her needs to her supervisor prior to returning to work. Any employee who is breastfeeding her child will be provided break times to express breast milk for her child. These breaks will be unpaid breaks unless the employee chooses to use her normal paid break time to express milk. For providers, appointment slots will be blocked as needed. For all other staff, a break in the middle of the work shift will be provided upon request. Esperanza realizes that both the time at which the break is scheduled and the time required to express the milk may vary from one woman to another. Therefore, the employee should discuss the schedule and amount of time needed with her supervisor so the proper coverage is available while the employee is away from her work duties. Breaks taken to express milk cannot be considered FMLA leave time. Facility: Esperanza will make every effort to provide a private place, other than a bathroom, that is shielded from view and free from intrusion from coworkers and the public, which may be used by the employee to express breast milk. This space may not be a permanent dedicated space for nursing mothers and it may vary from site to site. At minimum, the space will be private and have a door that can be locked, an electrical outlet, and a chair for the nursing mother to sit. Upon request and if possible, Esperanza will provide a place for the employee to store the expressed milk and pumping supplies without being disturbed. The employee is responsible for providing her own containers for storing the milk.

Esperanza supports and protects employees who are pregnant, recovering from childbirth, or have a related medical condition by providing reasonable accommodations to the employee upon request. An employee who is pregnant, recovering from childbirth, or has a related medical condition may submit a request to her supervisor for a reasonable accommodation such as:  Bathroom breaks  Rest breaks from standing for an extended period  Assistance with manual labor or lifting items  Changes to the work environment or job restructuring  Unpaid medical leave The request will be reviewed and approved by the employee’s supervisor and the Human Resources Department. Esperanza will make every effort to make a reasonable accommodation in response to the employee’s request. This accommodation may include reassignment to a vacant position, provided the employee can satisfy the performance requirements of that position. Esperanza may refuse any request that creates an undue hardship on clinical or business operations.

Esperanza prohibits discrimination against a qualified individual with a disability. This includes, but is not limited to discrimination with respect to application, hiring, promotion, discharge, compensation, benefits, training and all other aspects of employment in accordance with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and Americans with Disabilities Act Amendments (ADAA) and American. Disability means physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of the major life activities of an individual. Major life activities include the following: caring for oneself, performing manual tasks, seeing, hearing, eating, sleeping, walking, standing, lifting, bending, speaking, breathing, learning, reading, concentrating, thinking, communicating and working. An individual who has such impairment, has a record of such impairment or is regarded as having such impairment is an individual with a disability. Reasonable Accommodation Esperanza is committed to making reasonable accommodation(s) in practices and policies for an employee who qualifies as having a disability to enable the employee to perform the essential functions of his or her position. All requests for reasonable accommodation(s) should be presented to the Human Resources department or department supervisor and HR will follow up with the necessary paperwork for the employee to provide substantiation for their accommodation needs. Generally, reasonable accommodations will be made unless it creates an undue hardship for Esperanza.

Voluntary Termination Esperanza requires employees to give written notice of their intent to resign to their supervisor and the Human Resources Director. Esperanza employees are requested to give their supervisor as much advance notice of their intent to resign as possible. Exempt employees are expected to give a minimum of four weeks’ notice; non-exempt employees are expected to give a minimum of two weeks’ notice. All clinicians are required to give at least three months’ notice of their intent to resign as clinician’s schedules are established three months in advance. This will allow appropriate time to notify patients of the change and to reschedule them with another clinician. If proper notice is not given, employees will forfeit their unused vacation days at the end of employment. Upon termination of employment, all Esperanza employees are provided the opportunity to continue participation in the group health plan, at their own expense, through COBRA. Written notification of COBRA benefits will be provided within five business days of the last date of employment. Employees terminating their employment with Esperanza will participate in an exit interview with the Department of Human Resources. Involuntary Termination All involuntary terminations must be approved and processed by the employee’s manager, the Human Resources Director, and CEO or the CEO’s designee. Job Abandonment If an employee is absent from work without notification of the absence, Esperanza will consider that the employee has voluntarily resigned after the second consecutive day of absence.

Human Resources will schedule a meeting to conduct an exit interview. At this meeting the employee is given information regarding benefits options. The employee must return all Esperanza property, such as keys, records, materials, data, equipment, and credit cards to the Human Resources or verify the returns were made to his/her supervisor prior to the meeting. All outstanding debts including travel advances, other cash owed, or payment for equipment that has not been returned are deducted from the final paycheck in accordance with prior written authorization. Esperanza requires all employees terminating employment with Esperanza to participate in an exit interview. An employee may request an exit interview with his/her supervisor. Exit interviews may also take place at the request of the supervisor. Exit interviews are documented, signed, and placed in the employee’s personnel file. An exit interview provides a method for terminated employees to have an opportunity to discuss the reasons for and the procedural aspects of their termination. The exit interview is also an opportunity for terminated employees to provide feedback and recommendations regarding their employment experience at Esperanza. These suggestions will be used to improve the services, training, and working conditions of Esperanza. 

Esperanza maintains the right to provide severance pay (defined as additional compensation provided to an employee after departure from employment) on a discretionary basis. Severance pay will be given only to those individuals whose special circumstances have been approved by the CEO and Board of Directors, or Executive Officers of the Board of Directors. 

Under the provisions of the Pennsylvania Unemployment Compensation Law, employees at Esperanza are entitled to apply for income during periods of partial or total unemployment that occur through no fault of their own. If an employee is laid off due to grant or funding reductions and works less than full time due to lack of work, he or she should file a claim for benefits online at the Pennsylvania Unemployment Compensation website or apply in person at the Job Center nearest his or her home. 

Esperanza is committed to an overall culture of safety. EHC seeks to create a safe and peaceful environment for all patients, visitors and staff. Definition of Weapon: A weapon is an object, instrument, substance, or device which is intended to be used in a way that is likely to injure, kill, incapacitate, damage or destroy. Weapons include, but are not limited to firearms/guns, sling shots, stun guns/tasers, martial arts weapons, blades/knives greater than 3”, explosive devices, fireworks and other dangerous implements. Policy At Esperanza Health Center the safety and well-being of our patients, staff, and visitors are of paramount importance. In order to provide a secure environment conducive to healing and care, we have implemented a strict weapon-free policy within our premises. This policy applies to all individuals entering our facility, including patients, visitors, employees, vendors and contractors. Exemptions: Law enforcement officers and authorized security personnel, while on official duty and in uniform, are exempt from this policy Notice: Clear signage indicating the weapon-free policy will be prominently displayed at all entrances. The weapons policy will be reviewed with all employees at onboarding. Patients will sign a culture of safety acknowledgement upon registration and yearly, thereafter, as part of their patient update packet. Consequences: Employees in violation of this policy may be subject to sanctions as per Esperanza’s disciplinary policy up to and including, termination of employment. Patients in violation of this policy may be dismissed from the practice. See: procedural and reporting considerations Legal Considerations: Esperanza Health Center acknowledges that individuals with valid licenses to carry concealed firearms may have certain rights under Pennsylvania law. However, the health center reserves the right to maintain a weapon-free environment for the safety and comfort of all individuals on its premises. Procedural and Reporting Considerations  Security guards are trained to observe persons entering EHC facilities for possession of a weapon. If a weapon is observed, or if there is probable cause to believe that the person may be carrying a weapon, security will pull the person to the side and inquire. If a weapon is discovered, the person will be directed to secure the weapon outside of the facility, prior to services being rendered. Communication with the person will be done discreetly, and with the intent to communicate Esperanza’s commitment to the safety and wellbeing of patients, staff, and visitors.  If a person is observed to have a weapon while in the course of being seen as a patient, or as a participant in an EHC activity, employees are asked to use judgment in how they proceed. If the employee has a relationship with the patient/client (or feels comfortable broaching the subject), they should remind the patient/client of the EHC policy prohibiting weapons on premise. If the employee does not feel secure in having this conversation, a supervisor, clinician, security or administrator should be sought to address the situation. Providers, Supervisors/Managers, and Administrators, by nature of their job responsibility, should be ready to address situations of this nature.  Once a patient/client is informed of the policy, the Office Manager or Director of Programs should be informed so that a letter is sent to the patient/client reminding them of the policy and that a subsequent infraction will lead to dismissal from Esperanza. An incident report must be written describing the weapon seen and the discussion with the patient/client, as well as indicating that the letter was sent.  Note: If in the discussion with the patient/client it is perceived that the patient/client is ambivalent toward or dismissive of the culture of safety philosophy of Esperanza and that adherence is not forthcoming, Esperanza may forego the warning letter and move to direct dismissal. Any individual who observes another person in possession of a weapon on our premises is strongly encouraged to report the incident to security personnel. This weapon-free policy will be strictly enforced by Esperanza Health Center’s security personnel and management. The cooperation of all individuals entering our facility is vital in ensuring a safe and healing environment for everyone. By adhering to this policy, we contribute to the security and well-being of our community.
