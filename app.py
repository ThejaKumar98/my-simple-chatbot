The Amazon rainforest, often called the "lungs of the Earth," is the world's largest tropical rainforest. 
It covers approximately 5.5 million square kilometers and spans across nine countries in South America, 
with Brazil containing about 60% of the rainforest. The Amazon is home to an estimated 400 billion trees 
and contains about 10% of the world's known species. It plays a crucial role in regulating the global 
climate by absorbing carbon dioxide and producing oxygen. Unfortunately, deforestation threatens this 
vital ecosystem, with thousands of square kilometers being cleared each year for agriculture and logging.
